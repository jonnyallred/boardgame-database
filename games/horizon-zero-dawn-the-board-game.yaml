description: |
  Horizon Zero Dawn: The Board Game is a semi-cooperative tactical action game based on the
  acclaimed video game franchise. Players take the roles of hunters in a world reclaimed by
  nature, where robotic machines roam the wilderness. The core gameplay combines deck building
  with tactical positioning as players hunt increasingly powerful machines across modular map
  tiles. Each hunter has a unique deck of ability cards and can acquire new skills as they
  progress. Combat is resolved through card play and targeted strike mechanics that allow
  players to target specific machine components for strategic advantages. Players work together
  to hunt machines, but compete individually for glory. Funded via Kickstarter in 2018 and
  released in 2020, the game features detailed miniatures from the iconic machine creatures
  of the video game.
