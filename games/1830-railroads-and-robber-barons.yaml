# Description
description: |
  1830: The Game of Railroads and Robber Barons is the defining entry in the
  18XX series of stock market and railroad network games, designed by Francis
  Tresham and set during the Gilded Age of American railroading. Players act as
  investors buying and selling shares in railroad companies, and as directors
  operating those companies to build track networks and run profitable train
  routes.

  The game features two intertwined systems: a stock market where players
  manipulate share prices through strategic buying and selling, and a map phase
  where railroad presidents build routes, purchase trains, and collect revenue
  for shareholders. Directors can deliberately drain their companies to enrich
  themselves personally, creating a cutthroat atmosphere. 1830 is notorious for
  its complexity, punishing learning curve, and the depth of economic and
  political scheming it enables. It is widely considered one of the greatest
  board games ever designed and the progenitor of an entire genre.
