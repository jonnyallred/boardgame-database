# Description
description: |
  A deck-building dungeon delve where adventurers sneak into a dragon's lair
  to steal valuable artifacts. Build your deck of movement, combat, and skill
  cards while navigating a modular dungeon map. Every card that generates noise
  adds Clank! cubes to the bag — when the dragon attacks, cubes drawn from
  the bag deal damage. Race to grab the best loot and escape before the dragon
  wakes up, balancing greed against survival.
