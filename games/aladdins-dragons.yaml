# Description
description: |
  Aladdin's Dragons is an area-majority bidding game in which three to six
  players vie to collect valuable magical artifacts from the Caliph's treasure
  chamber. The board is divided into three zones: a resource-gathering lower
  section, a central area with powerful special-action spaces, and an upper
  artifact market. Each turn, players simultaneously and secretly distribute
  numbered bidding tokens face-down across board locations. The tokens are then
  revealed and resolved — higher bids win resources, access to actions, or the
  artifacts themselves. Special actions let players cast spells, block opponents,
  or trade resources. The game ends when all artifacts have been sold; the player
  who accumulated the most artifacts wins. Aladdin's Dragons won the Games
  Magazine Game of the Year award in 2001.
