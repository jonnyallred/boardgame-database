# Description
description: |
  1812: The Invasion of Canada recreates the War of 1812 with up to five players
  commanding three British factions (Redcoats, Canadian Militia, and Native
  Americans) or two American factions (Regulars and Militia), each represented
  by distinctively colored wooden cubes. The two sides cooperate within their
  alliances to control key towns and forts across the northern frontier. Each
  faction has its own deck of event, movement, and truce cards, and turn order
  within each round is determined by random draw — creating uncertainty that
  mirrors the fog of war. Combat uses faction-specific dice with different symbols
  for attack, retreat, and casualties. The game ends when a truce card is played
  by a faction that controls its key objectives, rewarding both tactical
  battlefield coordination and strategic objective prioritization.
