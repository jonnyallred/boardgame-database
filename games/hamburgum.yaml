description: |
  Hamburgum is a strategy game by Mac Gerdts set in the historic trading city of Hamburg, Germany.
  Players use the signature Gerdts rondel — a circular action selection mechanism — to choose
  from seven action spaces: Church, Trade, Cloth, Guildhall, Beer, Dockyard, and Sugar. Each
  turn, players advance their pawn around the rondel, with moving further costing more resources.
  Players produce beer, sugar, and cloth in their businesses, then sell these goods overseas with
  their fleet of merchant ships. The collected profits fund prestigious church donations, which
  score victory points. The game ends when six churches are fully constructed, rewarding players
  who best balance production, trade routes, and ecclesiastical investment. Notable for containing
  no dice or card luck — all decisions are pure strategy.
