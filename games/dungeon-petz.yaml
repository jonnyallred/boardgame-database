  Become the leader of an imp family running a pet shop that breeds and sells
  monsters to Dungeon Lords. Use simultaneous worker placement with groups of
  imps to acquire baby creatures, then raise them by managing their needs for
  food, play, and cleanliness. Keep your pets happy and healthy to sell them
  at exhibitions for maximum profit. Balance resource management with the
  unpredictable demands of magical creatures in this quirky euro game.
