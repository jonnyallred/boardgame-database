# Description
description: |
  Marvel United is a fast-paced cooperative game for 1-4 players in which heroes work together
  to thwart a supervillain's master plan. Each player controls an iconic Marvel hero — such as
  Captain America, Iron Man, or Black Widow — each with their own unique deck of cards.

  The game's signature mechanic is the Storyline: on your turn you play a card from your hand,
  but you also activate the icons on the card played by the previous hero. This chaining effect
  rewards coordination and creates satisfying combos as heroes build off each other's actions.
  Actions include moving around the modular city board, defeating Thug enemies, rescuing
  trapped Civilians, and using powerful Hero-specific abilities.

  Every three hero card plays, the Villain activates — drawing a card from their own deck that
  triggers a threat, spawns enemies, or advances their sinister scheme. This self-balancing
  mechanism works elegantly across all player counts. Players win by defeating the Villain
  directly; they lose if too many Civilians are captured, all Heroes are KO'd, or the Villain's
  master plan completes.

  Originally funded through a highly successful Kickstarter campaign in 2019, Marvel United
  launched at retail in 2020. The game is notable for its bold chibi-style miniatures sculpted
  by Edouard Guiton and its accessible ruleset that makes it approachable for families and new
  gamers while retaining enough variety through hero and villain combinations to reward repeat play.
