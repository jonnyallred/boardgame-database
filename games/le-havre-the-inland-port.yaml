# Description
description: |
  Le Havre: The Inland Port is a dedicated two-player game by Uwe Rosenberg that distills
  the port-building theme of the original Le Havre into a compact 30-minute experience.
  Players compete as harbour masters trying to construct the most profitable port by making
  clever use of 31 shared building tiles over 12 rounds.

  The central mechanism combines a resource wheel (borrowed from Rosenberg's Ora et Labora)
  with a building-use system. Each round, both players simultaneously choose one of the
  available buildings to use. When a building is used, it delivers resources based on its
  current position on the wheel — the longer a building sits unused, the more powerful its
  action becomes. However, buildings that go unused too long must be sold to the market at
  half value, creating constant pressure to act before your opponent beats you to it.

  Most buildings allow players to convert or accumulate resources on their personal warehouse
  boards, which have strict capacity limits — forcing careful optimisation of when and how
  to fill or empty storage. Players must balance building their economic engine against
  denying useful buildings to their opponent.

  The game won the International Gamers Award for Best 2-Player Strategy Game and is widely
  praised as an accessible gateway into Rosenberg's heavier euro designs.
