# Description
description: |
  Ca$h 'n Guns is a party game of bluffing and gangsters in which players
  are criminals dividing up loot after a heist — at gunpoint. Each player
  wields a foam pistol and a hand of ammo cards, some of which are real
  Bang! cards and some of which are harmless Click! bluffs.

  Each round, a Godfather calls out the steps of the standoff. All players
  simultaneously aim their foam guns at another player of their choice.
  Before cards are revealed, players may choose to chicken out, avoiding
  harm but forfeiting their share of that round's loot — at the cost of a
  Chicken token that reduces final winnings. Players who hold firm reveal
  their cards simultaneously: Bang! cards wound targets, while Click! cards
  are exposed as bluffs. A wounded player sits out the loot split and gains
  a bandage; accumulating too many bandages eliminates a player entirely.

  Survivors split the loot — diamonds, paintings, and cash — that was laid
  out at the round's start. The Godfather role passes each round, granting
  special abilities like redirecting gunfire. After eight rounds, the player
  with the most money wins.

  This second edition (2014) adds new loot types and a revised Godfather
  mechanic compared to the 2005 original. The game shines with larger groups
  and rewards reading opponents, calling bluffs, and knowing when to back
  down. Its foam gun components make it instantly accessible and visually
  striking on the table.
