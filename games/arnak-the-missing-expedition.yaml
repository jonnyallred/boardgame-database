# Description
description: |
  Lost Ruins of Arnak: The Missing Expedition is the second major expansion for
  the acclaimed Lost Ruins of Arnak. Professor Kutil has gone missing while exploring
  the ruins of Arnak, and players must unravel the mystery of his disappearance.

  The expansion's centerpiece is a six-chapter solo and two-player cooperative
  campaign, where players work through a branching narrative with special event cards
  that offer multiple-choice rewards. The campaign is fully playable solo or
  cooperatively with two players, taking on a distinct cooperative shape.

  The Missing Expedition also adds two new expedition leaders (The Mechanic and
  The Journalist), a new double-sided research board with two research tracks,
  new site tiles, guardian tiles, idol tokens, items, artifacts, and a wealth of
  new cards. Two additional leader archetypes (The Prospector and The Traveler) can
  be created using base game components. All new leaders are fully compatible with
  the Expedition Leaders expansion.
