# Description
description: |
  Harrow County: The Game of Gothic Conflict is an asymmetric strategy game for 1-3 players
  inspired by the Harrow County comic series by Cullen Bunn and Tyler Crook. Each player
  controls a faction — witches, ghosts, or other dark forces — each with radically different
  objectives: protect, destroy, rule, or infect the cursed land of Harrow County.

  Players alternate selecting from four shared actions each round (move, spawn, strengthen,
  and faction-specific abilities) using mason jar tokens that limit each player to three
  choices per round, creating tight action economy decisions. Combat is resolved through a
  cube tower built directly into the game box, providing a thematic chit-pull system where
  units that fall through are eliminated while others are held back for future battles.

  The game blends route building and network control on a hex grid with king-of-the-hill
  scoring, rewarding presence in key locations. A solo mode and a reduced-rules introductory
  variant are included. The Fair Folk expansion adds additional factions and scales the game
  to four players.
