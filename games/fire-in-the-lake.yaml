# Description
description: |
  Fire in the Lake is an asymmetric wargame published by GMT Games in 2014, set during
  the Vietnam War. It is part of the acclaimed COIN (Counterinsurgency) series. Four
  factions — the US/ARVN (Government of Vietnam), the NVA (North Vietnamese Army), the
  VC (Viet Cong), and the NLF — each pursue different and asymmetric victory conditions
  representing their historical objectives. COIN uses a shared event card deck with
  sequential action opportunities, where factions must decide whether to execute card
  events or take standard operations. Propaganda cards periodically trigger victory checks.
  The game captures the complexity of counterinsurgency warfare: military force alone
  cannot win; economic aid, political legitimacy, and population control all matter.
  Fire in the Lake is regarded as one of the finest historical wargames ever designed,
  praised for its educational depth and the elegant COIN system.
