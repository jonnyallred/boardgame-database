# Description
description: |
  Art Society immerses two to four players in the competitive world of high-end
  art collecting, where the goal is to build the most prestigious private gallery.
  Each round, players bid at auctions to acquire artwork tiles representing real
  and inspired masterpieces. After winning pieces, players arrange them on their
  personal drawing-room wall, scoring points for matching styles, colors, and
  patterns in adjacent placements. The dual challenge of bidding smart and
  arranging strategically makes the game deceptively engaging for its short
  playtime. Barnes & Noble recognized Art Society as its 2023 Game of the Year,
  and the game's lavishly illustrated artwork makes it as visually appealing as
  the collections players assemble.
