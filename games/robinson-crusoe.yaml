# Description
description: |
  Players are castaways stranded on a cursed island, working together to survive
  its deadly weather, wild beasts, and mounting hardships. Each scenario presents a
  unique goal — building a signal fire, rescuing a castaway, or escaping cannibals —
  while the island itself fights back through a relentless event deck. Workers are
  deployed each round to explore, gather, build, and hunt, but every action risks
  injury or failure via dice rolls. The game is notorious for its punishing difficulty
  and rich narrative atmosphere.
