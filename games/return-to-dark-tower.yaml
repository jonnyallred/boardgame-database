# Description
description: |
  Return to Dark Tower is a cooperative fantasy adventure game for 1-4 players and a
  reimagining of the classic 1981 Milton Bradley game Dark Tower. Players take on the
  roles of heroes ruling over kingdoms that surround a towering, Bluetooth-enabled
  electronic centrepiece connected to a companion app.

  Each game begins with heroes gathering resources, cleansing corrupted buildings, defeating
  monsters, and completing quests to build up their strength and refine their abilities.
  The Tower — imposing, motorised, and driven by the app — dispenses skull tokens and
  corruption across the realm, which players must work together to manage. As the game
  progresses, the enemy lurking within the Tower is revealed and players must coordinate
  for a dramatic final assault.

  The game blends traditional Euro-style engine building and resource management with
  app-driven narrative events, random encounters, and a physical tower that physically
  rotates and drops skull tokens into the board's quadrants. Each hero has unique
  abilities and a personal deck that evolves through play. The app tracks game state,
  narrates events, and manages the adversary's behaviour, providing a different experience
  each session. Designed by Isaac Childres (Gloomhaven) and Rob Daviau (Pandemic Legacy),
  Return to Dark Tower launched via Kickstarter in 2020 and was delivered to backers in 2022.
