# Description
description: |
  A cooperative adventure game and spiritual sequel to the 1981 classic
  Dark Tower. Players take on hero roles, gathering resources, cleansing
  corrupted buildings, defeating monsters, and undertaking quests across
  a fantasy kingdom threatened by an awakening evil. The game centers
  around a physical electronic tower that drives the narrative and
  spawns threats via a companion app. Act One builds your heroes'
  abilities through engine building and resource management, while Act
  Two delivers a dramatic final confrontation against the tower itself.
  Combines classic adventure gameplay with modern app-integrated design.
