# Description
description: |
  Taj Mahal is an award-winning auction and area control game for 2-5 players designed by
  Reiner Knizia, set in 18th century India during the Mughal Empire. Over 12 rounds, players
  compete to influence the most powerful princes across different provinces of India. Each round
  features a simultaneous card-based auction using five types of influence cards representing
  different power types: politicians, elephants, viziers, palaces, and princesses. The player
  who wins each category gains control of provinces and collects goods, while connections
  between adjacent provinces multiply their value. The central tension is knowing when to
  commit cards to compete for a province's prizes and when to gracefully withdraw to conserve
  resources for future rounds. Taj Mahal won the Deutscher Spiele Preis in 2000 and remains
  a beloved classic of strategic euro design.
