# Description
description: |
  A standalone version of the Spiel des Jahres-winning Dixit, expanded to
  support up to 12 players. Each turn, the storyteller gives a clue for one
  of their cards, other players submit matching cards from their hands, and
  everyone votes on which card belongs to the storyteller. Scoring rewards
  clues that are neither too obvious nor too obscure. Includes 84 new
  cards illustrated by Piero and Marie Cardouat, voting boards for large
  groups, and variant rules for team and party play.
