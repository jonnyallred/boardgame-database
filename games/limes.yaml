# Description
description: |
  Limes is a compact 1-2 player tile-laying game set two thousand years ago on the borders of
  the Roman Empire. Players simultaneously build their own 4x4 grids of landscape tiles,
  growing grain, catching fish, chopping wood, and staffing watchtowers to guard against
  barbarian raids and fires.

  Each round, one tile is revealed from the shared deck and both players must place an
  identical copy of that tile into their personal tableau, adjacent to or touching a corner
  of an already-played card. Optionally, a player may also place or move one of their worker
  figures onto a tile. The game always runs exactly 16 rounds, ending when each player has
  completed a full 4x4 square of landscape cards.

  Scoring rewards players for creating large contiguous areas of matching terrain types,
  with worker placement multiplying the value of completed regions. The simultaneous play
  means both players face exactly the same sequence of tiles but must make independent
  spatial decisions about where to place each one — creating a tense puzzle in which the
  same hand of tiles can produce vastly different outcomes.

  Limes won the 2014 Kinderspielexperten "8-to-13-year-olds" award and was nominated for
  the 2014 International Gamers Award in the two-player category. It is based on the
  designer's earlier game Cities, sharing the same core system but with entirely different
  scoring. A solo variant is also included.
