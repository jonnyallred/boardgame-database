description: |
  Heads of State is a set-collection card game where players collect sets of cards — including
  gold, troops, titles, castles, and church ranks — to raise noble families in four European
  kingdoms: England, France, Spain, and the German States. Players compete to place their nobles
  in provinces across these countries and earn victory points through multiple paths: first noble
  in the most provinces, dominating a single country, achieving the full set of noble ranks,
  or having the most nobles of each rank at game end. Treachery cards allow players to remove
  opponents' nobles through historical methods — the guillotine, the Inquisition, the axeman,
  the gallows, and assassination. The blend of competitive placement with treacherous take-that
  mechanics creates a tense game of dynastic ambition.
