# Description
description: |
  A social deduction game set in 1930s Germany where players are secretly
  divided into Liberals and Fascists, with one Fascist secretly designated
  as Hitler. Each round, a President and Chancellor are elected to enact
  policies from a shuffled deck. Liberals win by passing five liberal
  policies or assassinating Hitler; Fascists win by passing six fascist
  policies or electing Hitler as Chancellor. Tense, accusatory, and
  endlessly replayable.
