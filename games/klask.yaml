# Description
description: |
  A magnetic dexterity game often described as a tabletop mix of air hockey
  and foosball. Players control magnetic strikers under the playing field
  to push a ball into their opponent's goal while avoiding falling into
  their own hole or picking up magnetic obstacles. Fast-paced, physical,
  and immediately accessible.
