# Description
description: |
  Riftforce is a sharp two-player card dueling game in which each player drafts four of ten
  available guilds — each representing a different elemental faction with a unique special
  power — to forge their own asymmetric alliance before battle begins. The ten guilds offer
  210 unique four-guild combinations per player, ensuring high replayability and fresh
  matchups every game.

  Both players deploy their guild's elementals along five neutral Rift locations that form
  the battlefield between them. On each turn, a player must choose one of three actions:
  play cards from hand to strengthen their position at locations along the Rift, spend
  matching cards to activate powerful elemental attacks and combos, or draw cards to
  replenish their options. The interplay between deploying for board presence and spending
  cards for attacks is the central tension of the game.

  Players score Riftforce points by destroying their opponent's elementals and by
  controlling Rift locations. The first player to accumulate 12 Riftforce wins — though
  their opponent may get one final turn to ensure equal opportunities. The game was
  nominated for the 2021 Kennerspiel des Jahres and praised for hiding surprising strategic
  depth beneath simple rules.
