# Description
description: |
  Hanabi is a cooperative card game in which players collectively attempt to build a
  perfect fireworks display. The game takes its name from the Japanese word for fireworks.
  The central twist: each player can see everyone else's cards but not their own, so players
  must rely on limited clues given by teammates to figure out what to play.

  On each turn, a player may either give a clue to another player (indicating all cards of
  a specific color or number in their hand), play a card to build one of five color-coded
  firework sequences (1 through 5), or discard a card to recover a used clue token.
  The game starts with 8 clue tokens and 3 fuse tokens; running out of fuses or
  misplaying ends the game. The team scores points based on how many fireworks were
  successfully launched, with a perfect score of 25 being extremely rare.

  Hanabi won the Spiel des Jahres in 2013, making it the first cooperative game to win
  the award. Its elegance lies in the strict communication limits and the fascinating
  psychology of conveying and interpreting imperfect information. Players must develop
  shared conventions about what clues mean — for instance, whether a clue about a
  "1" means "play this" or simply "here's useful information." The game scales well
  from 2 to 5 players and plays in under 30 minutes.
