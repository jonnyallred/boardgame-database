# Description
description: |
  Work together to stop four deadly diseases from spreading across the
  globe. Players take on unique roles - medic, scientist, researcher,
  dispatcher, and more - each with special abilities. Travel between
  cities, treat infections, share knowledge, and discover cures before
  time runs out. The Infection deck escalates tension as Epidemic cards
  reshuffle the discard pile on top, creating devastating outbreaks.
  A landmark cooperative design that defined the genre.
