description: |
  Giganten is an economic strategy game about competing oil companies bidding for contracts and
  drilling rights on an oil field. Players buy and sell oil, compete for lucrative sales contracts,
  and drill at oilfield sites on the board. Bidding drives much of the competition: players nominate
  contract tiles and drilling sites at auction, requiring opponents to pay up or let rivals claim
  valuable resources. The game earned the 1999 Spiel des Jahres Kritikerpreis (Critics' Award)
  for its elegant blend of bidding tension and strategic resource management. Building an efficient
  oil empire requires balancing aggressive acquisition of new sites with the cash management
  needed to fulfill contracts profitably.
