# Description
description: |
  The definitive 18xx game of railroad building and stock market manipulation
  in the northeastern United States. Players buy and sell shares in railroad
  companies, lay track, and run trains for revenue while trying to dump
  failing companies on unsuspecting opponents. A ruthless economic game
  where bankrupting other players is a viable and encouraged strategy.
