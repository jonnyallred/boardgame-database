# Description
description: |
  Village is a euro strategy game designed by Inka and Markus Brand, published by
  Eggertspiele in 2011. It won both the Kennerspiel des Jahres and Deutscher Spiele Preis
  in 2012. Set in a medieval village, players manage families across multiple generations,
  pursuing different paths to prestige and victory.

  Players can farm, craft goods, travel to foreign cities, participate in church politics,
  or seek election to the village council — each path yielding different point-scoring
  opportunities. The game's signature mechanic involves the passage of time: older family
  members eventually die, and players must decide when to let them pass in order to make
  room for new generations. Deceased villagers who have achieved notable things are
  commemorated in the Village Chronicle, awarding end-game points.

  This elegant integration of death as a game mechanism creates genuinely touching
  moments alongside the competition. Resource management flows through colored cubes
  acquired from a central market, where earlier buyers get first choice but later buyers
  can take from multiple positions. Village is celebrated for its thematic integration,
  strategic variety, and emotional resonance.
