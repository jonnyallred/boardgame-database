# Description
description: |
  In Marrakesh, players compete to be the most influential family in the city through strategic use of assistants and resources. Set in the historic Moroccan city founded in 1070 AD, known as "The Pearl of the South," players must gain influence in the mosque and palace, sponsor research in the school of scholars, dispatch caravans across the Sahara, and haggle for valuable luxury goods in the souks.

  The game is played over three seasons with four rounds each. Each turn, players simultaneously and secretly choose three colored cylinders (keshis) from behind their screen, then in turn order place matching colored assistants on their player boards to perform actions. All cylinders are then placed in the cube tower, and players draft the cylinders that emerge to boost the effectiveness of their future actions in those colors. The unique cube tower mechanism creates uncertainty and tactical decisions as players never know exactly what will be available each round.

  Like many Stefan Feld designs, Marrakesh features multiple paths to victory with numerous scoring opportunities including exploring the desert, harvesting figs, fishing, progressing on mosque and palace tracks, collecting luxury items, and using scholars to draft scrolls.
