# Description
description: |
  Take Time is a cooperative puzzle card game published by Libellud in October 2025.
  Players work together to strategically place 12 Solar and Lunar cards face down around
  a clock face, passing 40 increasingly challenging tests across 10 chapters.

  The game challenges teams to coordinate their card placement without revealing the
  cards' faces, building a shared mental model of what's been placed where. The clock
  structure creates a distinctive spatial puzzle, as timing and position both matter.

  Designed for 1-4 players ages 10 and up, Take Time offers a gentle cooperative
  experience with escalating difficulty through its chapter structure, making it
  accessible to families and casual groups while still providing satisfying puzzle-
  solving challenges.
