# Description
description: |
  51st State: Master Set is the definitive edition of Portal Games' post-apocalyptic
  card game, set in a world where the United States has collapsed and new powers vie
  for control of the ruins. Players lead one of four factions trying to build a new
  nation — the 51st State — from the rubble of the old world.

  The game's central mechanic revolves around the versatility of every card: each
  location can be razed for an immediate burst of resources, dealt with for recurring
  income, or built to provide a powerful ongoing ability. This three-way choice creates
  rich decisions every turn as players manage their hand, develop their engine, and
  compete for dominance.

  The Master Set consolidates 88 cards from the original base game with 50 cards each
  from the New Era and Winter expansions, all rebalanced for a cohesive experience.
  It also introduced solo and two-player modes alongside the full multiplayer game.
