# Description
description: |
  Set in a post-apocalyptic United States, 51st State: Master Set puts players
  in control of factions (Mutants, Traders, New Yorkers, or Appalachians)
  vying to establish a new nation from the ruins. Each card can be used in three
  ways: Raze for immediate resources, Deal for recurring production, or Build
  to add permanent abilities to your tableau. Race to 25 victory points while
  managing scarce resources in this tense card-driven engine builder. This
  edition includes the original base game plus New Era and Winter expansions
  for a total of 188 cards.
