# Description
description: |
  Build a space empire, research technology, command fleets, and battle for
  galactic dominance in this streamlined 4X epic. Each player controls a
  unique alien species with asymmetric starting abilities. Explore hexagonal
  sectors, colonize planets for resource income, and design custom ships by
  slotting in tech components. Diplomacy is fragile and betrayal is rewarded.
  The second edition overhauls the production with stunning miniatures and
  quality components from CMON while refining rules from the 2011 original.
