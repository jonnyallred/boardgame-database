# Description
description: |
  HONK! is a competitive goose-feeding set collection game for 2-5 players in which
  everyone races to collect the most eggs from a gaggle of escaped geese. On their
  turn a player either takes two different food cards or spends food cards to claim
  one goose — each of the eight goose breeds requires a specific combination of food
  symbols printed on it.

  The first goose of a breed earns one egg; a second of the same breed earns two
  eggs; a third earns three, rewarding players who focus their collection. Geese at
  the bottom of the draw pile hide golden eggs worth 1-3 bonus points, creating
  hidden victory points and a timing incentive to push for rarer cards early.

  Designed as a low-luck gateway title for younger players (ages 5+), the game
  features chunky cardboard geese and a charming, accessible ruleset that introduces
  set collection and hand management concepts without heavy math or reading. HONK!
  won the 2022 Origins Award for Best Family Game.
