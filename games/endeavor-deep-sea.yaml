# Description
description: |
  Lead an independent ocean research institute to explore the deep sea and
  protect fragile marine ecosystems. Players recruit field experts, explore dive
  sites, publish ecological papers, and launch conservation efforts across a
  modular underwater map. Actions chain together through a distinctive activation
  system, and tech tracks unlock increasingly powerful options. Playable solo,
  cooperatively, or competitively, with game length scaling to player count.
  A Kennerspiel des Jahres nominee praised for its elegant design.
