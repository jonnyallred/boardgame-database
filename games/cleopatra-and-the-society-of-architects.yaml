description: |
  Cleopatra and the Society of Architects is a card-drafting and building game published by Days
  of Wonder where 3-5 players compete to become the richest architect to survive the construction
  of Cleopatra's palace. Players collect resource cards to build pieces of an impressive 3D
  palace — columns, sphinxes, obelisks, doors, and architectural decorations — earning talents
  for each contribution. The key tension comes from corruption: using special character cards gains
  powerful advantages but adds corruption amulets to your personal stash. At each round's end,
  players secretly bid talents to the gods; the highest bidder sheds corruption while lowest
  bidders gain more. At game end, the most corrupt player is fed to Cleopatra's crocodile —
  eliminated regardless of their wealth. The actual 3D palace constructed during play creates
  a spectacular table presence unique in the hobby.
