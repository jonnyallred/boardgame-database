# Description
description: |
  Lead a house of Drow in the Underdark, combining deck building with
  area control on a shared board. Recruit monsters, cultists, and demons
  to your deck while placing troops to dominate locations like
  Menzoberranzan and Blingdenstone. Cards provide both influence to buy
  better cards and power to deploy and assassinate troops on the map.
  From the designers of Lords of Waterdeep. Board sections scale with
  player count to keep competition tight.
