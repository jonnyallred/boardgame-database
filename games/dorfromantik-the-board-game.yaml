# Description
description: |
  Dorfromantik: The Board Game is a cooperative puzzle game adapted from the acclaimed
  video game by Toukana Interactive. Players work together, taking turns drawing and
  placing hexagonal landscape tiles to build an ever-expanding countryside of wheat
  fields, forests, villages, meadows, rivers, and railways. The goal is to score as
  many points as possible by fulfilling task tokens — completing enclosed regions of
  the required size — with the group sharing a single collective score.

  The game ships with a basic standalone mode and a rich campaign system. In campaign
  play, players unlock small sealed boxes as their scores cross thresholds, gradually
  adding new tile types, special tiles, and scoring rules that increase the complexity
  and replayability across many sessions. Completing tasks rewards the group with bonus
  tiles, helping extend the draw pile and push for a higher score.

  Winner of the 2023 Spiel des Jahres (Game of the Year), Dorfromantik earned wide
  praise for its calm, contemplative atmosphere, accessibility for non-gamers, and the
  satisfying tension of fitting tiles together perfectly. It plays equally well solo or
  with a full table, making it an ideal gateway and family title.
