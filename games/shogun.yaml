# Description
description: |
  Compete as feudal Japanese daimyos vying for control of provinces across
  Japan over multiple seasons. Combat is resolved using a unique cube tower
  that remembers past battles, creating unpredictable yet strategic results.
  Simultaneous action selection adds tension as players must anticipate
  opponents' moves while managing armies and resources.
