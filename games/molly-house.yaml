# Description
description: |
  Molly House is a competitive card and dice game set in 18th-century London,
  where players inhabit the hidden world of molly houses — secret gathering
  places for queer communities seeking companionship, celebration, and survival
  in a society that persecuted them. The Society for the Reformation of Manners
  looms as an ever-present threat, and players must balance joy against the risk
  of exposure.

  Each turn players move their pawn across the board to action spaces, then
  draft and play hand cards representing vices, desires, and encounters. The
  central activity is hosting festivities at the Molly House: players take turns
  contributing cards from their hands until everyone passes, then the strongest
  poker-style hand is assembled and players score Joy points for cards they
  contributed. Desire cards played to your personal board gain multipliers from
  matching Molly cards, rewarding careful suit management.

  A Joy Track functions as the victory point meter, while an Evidence pile
  tracks the threat of raid and persecution — dice rolls determine how threats
  spread, adding an element of press-your-luck tension. The game blends luck
  with meaningful card play decisions, evoking a sense of fragile community
  and celebration under duress. Designed by Jo Kelly, Cole Wehrle, and Ricky
  Royal, Molly House is notable for its rich historical theme and its frank
  engagement with LGBTQ+ history.
