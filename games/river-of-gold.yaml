# Description
description: |
  River of Gold is a competitive euro game set in the Legend of the Five Rings universe, where players take on the roles of merchant traders representing legendary samurai clans — Crab, Crane, Mantis, or Scorpion — vying for wealth and influence along Rokugan's fabled river. Each turn, players roll a die and use Divine Favor tokens to adjust their result, then take one of three actions: sail their ships downstream to collect coins and goods, invest in building trade ports, markets, or shrines, or fulfill customer contracts for rewards and end-game bonuses. The game progresses through two eras, with competition intensifying as building tiles grow scarce and players race to maximize area influence and contract points. Victory is determined by a combination of regional influence, completed contracts, and manor house bonuses, rewarding flexible strategies and opportunistic play. The game features a stunning embossed metallic gold game board illustrated by fantasy cartographer Francesca Baerald, and ships with a Patrons mini-expansion included.
