# Description
description: |
  Compete as investors in 18th-century African trading companies. Each
  round, simultaneously select action cards from your hand to expand
  company trading posts, acquire shares, track your bookkeeping, and
  collect diamonds. A unique rotating hand mechanism forces tough
  decisions about which cards to recover. After seven rounds, the
  player with the most valuable portfolio of shares, books, diamonds,
  and cash wins. Winner of the 2016 Deutscher Spielepreis.
