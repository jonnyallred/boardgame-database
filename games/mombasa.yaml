# Description
description: |
  Mombasa is a heavy economic Euro game in which 2-4 players compete to
  build the most profitable portfolio by acquiring shares in four historical
  trading companies based in Mombasa, Cape Town, Saint-Louis, and Cairo, then
  expanding those companies' trading posts across the African continent.

  The game's signature mechanic is its segmented deck-building hand system.
  Each round, players simultaneously select action cards from their hand and
  place them face-down. Cards are then revealed and executed, driving actions
  such as expanding company networks on the map, gaining income from chartered
  routes, acquiring new cards, and buying or selling shares. After each round,
  players do not reclaim their entire hand; instead, a unique rotating-display
  mechanic means you pick up only one of several "resting piles" of previously
  played cards. Planning which cards you will have available in future turns is
  a central strategic challenge.

  A parallel track involves a book-keeping mechanic where players advance
  markers along income tracks for each company in which they hold shares,
  generating compounding returns over the game's seven rounds. Diamonds and
  other bonus resources add further scoring paths. After seven rounds the
  player with the highest total value — shares, books, diamonds, and cash —
  wins.

  Mombasa won the Deutscher Spielepreis in 2016 and received a Kennerspiel
  des Jahres recommendation the same year. It was later reimplemented as
  Skymines (2022), which retains the core hand management system in a
  science-fiction setting.
