# Description
description: |
  Belratti is a cooperative deduction game themed around outsmarting a notorious
  art forger. Players split into two teams: painters and museum directors. The
  museum directors reveal two picture cards defining the visual theme of an
  upcoming exhibition. Painters then silently select matching cards from their
  individual decks — but four forgeries (representing the infamous Belratti) are
  secretly shuffled into the exhibition submissions. The museum directors must
  identify which submitted cards are genuine and which are the forger's fakes.
  The challenge lies in painters communicating theme through card selection without
  speaking, while museum directors develop intuition for what was intentionally
  chosen versus randomly inserted. Recommended for the 2019 Spiel des Jahres and
  winner of the 2018 Fairplay À la carte award.
