description: |
  CloudAge is a dystopian engine-building game co-designed by Alexander Pfister where players
  travel through a dark future in airships above dried-up landscapes. Players visit cities,
  battle Cloud militia, and develop their engines through an innovative card-sleeving system —
  sleeving cards together combines their resource-gathering capabilities in a new form of
  resource management. The game mixes deck building, resource management, and engine building
  across a campaign structure with connected scenarios. Players must balance expanding their
  airship's capabilities against immediate tactical needs in a world where the sky is a
  contested frontier. Pfister brings his signature mixture of tight action efficiency and
  emergent engine complexity to this post-apocalyptic adventure game.
