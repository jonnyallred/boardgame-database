# Description
description: |
  Undaunted: Normandy is a two-player deck-building wargame designed by Trevor Benjamin
  and David Thompson, published by Osprey Games in 2019. It won the BoardGameGeek Game
  of the Year award and is widely acclaimed for combining accessible deckbuilding
  mechanics with genuine tactical depth.

  Players lead American or German forces through 12 scenarios depicting the 30th Infantry
  Division's campaign from Omaha Beach to Mortain. Each unit on the board corresponds
  directly to cards in the player's deck — the game's signature mechanic is casualty
  representation: when a unit is successfully attacked, its cards are removed from the
  deck, and if no cards remain, the unit is eliminated from the board.

  This elegant connection between deck state and board presence creates fog of war and
  command-and-control tension organically. Players use multi-use cards for either
  movement, combat, or reinforcement, adding hand management decisions to the tactical
  positioning puzzle. The progressive campaign tells a coherent historical story while
  each scenario plays in under 75 minutes, making Undaunted: Normandy an ideal entry
  point for wargaming and a standout in the deck-building genre.
