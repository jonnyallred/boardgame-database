# Description
description: |
  Terra Mystica is a deep, no-luck strategy game in which 2-5 players each control one of 14 asymmetric fantasy factions, each bound to a specific terrain type on a hexagonal map. The central challenge is terraforming adjacent hexes into your faction's home terrain type, then constructing and upgrading a hierarchy of buildings to generate resources and expand your civilization. Players compete across six rounds, managing workers, gold, and a unique three-bowl power system that allows tokens to cycle into a spendable pool through proximity to opponents' structures. Four cult tracks offer a secondary scoring dimension, rewarding devotion to earth, fire, water, and air. With highly asymmetric factions, variable scoring tiles, and a full-information design that rewards long-term planning, Terra Mystica is considered one of the definitive heavy Euro games and won the 2013 Deutscher Spiele Preis.
