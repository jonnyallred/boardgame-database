# Description
description: |
  Evenfall is a worker placement and engine building game published in 2023 with a dark
  fantasy aesthetic. Players are clan leaders of witches competing to gather magical
  resources, master spells, and control locations across a mystical world at the edge of
  dusk. Workers are sent to various locations to collect moon dust and other resources,
  hire powerful witches with unique abilities, and unlock spells that generate ongoing
  benefits. The game features a card-driven spell system where players build engines
  from their gathered witches and spells, creating powerful combination chains. End-game
  scoring rewards players who optimized their spell networks and controlled key locations.
  Evenfall is praised for its striking visual design, streamlined worker placement rules,
  and satisfying engine-building arc across its runtime.
