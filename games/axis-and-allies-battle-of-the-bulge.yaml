# Description
description: |
  Axis & Allies: Battle of the Bulge is a standalone two-player wargame
  simulating Germany's last major Western Front offensive in December 1944. One
  player commands the German forces attempting to break through Allied lines
  and reach Antwerp; the other commands the Allied coalition defending their
  supply lines. Unlike the standard Axis & Allies formula, this entry introduces
  supply mechanics, with trucks ferrying ammunition and reinforcements to the
  front. Overland movement and road movement use different rates, and late-battle
  air support enters play in later turns as the Allies recover from the initial
  shock. Combat uses specialized dice with randomized casualties. The focused
  historical scenario and streamlined rules make it one of the most accessible
  entries in the Axis & Allies family.
