# Description
description: |
  Build and launch ships to send guests on luxurious space vacations.
  As a supervisor at a galactic cruise company, compete to become the
  next CEO over three eras. Draw blueprints, build rooms onto rockets,
  advertise cruises, and launch guests into the cosmos. Worker placement
  with a bumping mechanism - placing on an occupied space rewards the
  displaced worker's owner with funding. Technology tokens connect
  action spaces and expand your resource storage capacity.
