# Description
description: |
  Catan Histories: Settlers of America – Trails to Rails is a standalone game in the Catan
  family set in 19th-century America. Players guide wagon trains of settlers westward across
  a hex-tile map of the United States, founding new cities as they push toward the Pacific.
  All settlements begin on the East Coast, and as the game progresses the resource-producing
  hexes follow the frontier westward, making Eastern cities progressively less valuable.

  Resources include brick, cattle, coal, grain, and lumber, collected by rolling two dice
  each turn. Unlike standard Catan, players cannot build settlements directly — instead they
  build settlers and pay grain to move them overland to claim new city sites. There are no
  upgrades to cities; expansion is achieved purely through geographic spread.

  A second layer of gameplay involves railroad construction and train movement. Players lay
  rail links and move trains to deliver goods to opponents' cities. Gold is earned by using
  your own or others' rail networks. The first player to deliver 8 goods to other players'
  cities (10 in a 3-player game) wins, making this a race game rather than a points game.

  The game was the first Catan-series title released exclusively in English, and the third
  entry in the Catan Histories line. It won the Origins Award in 2010.
