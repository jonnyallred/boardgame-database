# Description
description: |
  An asymmetric two-player card-driven game about the Watergate scandal.
  One player takes on the role of Nixon's administration, trying to build
  enough momentum to survive the scandal. The other plays as the newspaper
  editors, investigating and connecting informants to break the story.
  Cards can be played for their event text or their value in the tug-of-war
  over evidence and initiative tokens. Tense, thematic, and elegantly
  designed. Winner of the 2019 Golden Geek Best 2-Player Board Game award.
