# Description
description: |
  Bid for turn order, then pick up and distribute meeples across a modular
  grid of tiles using a mancala mechanism. The last meeple you place
  determines your action among five tribes: Viziers, Elders, Merchants,
  Builders, and Assassins. Claim tiles for area control, collect goods for
  set bonuses, and recruit powerful Djinns with unique abilities. A unique
  blend of classic mancala with modern Euro strategy.
