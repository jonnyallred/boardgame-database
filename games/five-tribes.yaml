# Description
description: |
  Navigate the mythical land of Naqala by moving meeples across a grid of tiles
  in a unique mancala-style mechanism. Pick up all meeples of one color from a
  tile, move them one at a time across adjacent tiles, and drop the last meeple
  to trigger that tile's action. Collect sets of colored meeples to hire djinns
  with magical powers and score points through camels, goods, gold, and palm trees.
  Turn order is determined by bidding, creating constant tension over key moves.
