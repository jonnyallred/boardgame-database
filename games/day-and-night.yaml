# Description
description: |
  Day & Night is an asymmetric 2-player abstract strategy game set in a fantasy world
  where Lady Day and Lady Night duel for the right to remain in their celestial palace.
  Each player commands a unique side — Day or Night — with distinct powers and mechanics,
  racing to build two Temples and honor the gods to enforce justice.

  The game won the International Gamers Award in 2009 in the 2-Player category. Players
  alternate turns taking actions with their asymmetric pieces, managing area control on
  a shared board where the interplay of Day and Night forces creates the central tension.
  The thematic duality of the two sides is reflected in genuinely different play styles,
  making it a compelling head-to-head contest for players who enjoy deep positional thinking
  in a compact package.
