# Description
description: |
  Amul is a card game of bustling bazaars for 2-8 aspiring merchants on the Silk Road.
  Players take on the role of merchants attempting to collect valuable sets of goods,
  hire guards, assemble caravans, and complete contracts by drafting from a central
  market.

  Each round, players simultaneously choose one card from their hand and place it
  face-down into the shared market. Then, in turn order, players each pick one card
  from the market — meaning your card choice influences what options others will
  have while also securing what you need. Over nine rounds, players build up sets
  of goods and fulfill contracts to earn Prestige points.

  Amul plays quickly and scales well to larger groups, making it a strong choice
  for casual game nights. Its simultaneous card-selection mechanism creates a layer
  of bluffing and reading opponents while keeping downtime low.
