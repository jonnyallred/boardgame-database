# Description
description: |
  Draft and collect cards representing twelve fantasy tribes — giants, merfolk,
  halflings, minotaurs, and more — to form bands that claim control over the
  six regions of Ethnos. Only six of the twelve tribes are used each game,
  and each tribe has a unique special ability, creating high replayability.
  Playing a band forces you to discard the rest of your hand face-up for
  opponents to grab, adding a tense push-your-luck element as three dragon
  cards lurk in the deck to end each of the three scoring ages.
