# Description
description: |
  Ethnos is an area control and set collection game published by CMON in 2017. Players
  collect cards representing twelve fantasy races — including Giants, Merfolk, Wizards,
  Trolls, and more — and form bands of creatures to claim control of regions on the map
  for glory points. On their turn, players either draw a card from the line or play a
  band: a set of cards sharing a race or a color. When a band is played, its leader
  determines a special power while the rest of the cards are discarded to the table for
  opponents to pick up. Control markers placed in regions score at the end of each of
  the three ages based on territory majority. The deceptively simple rules mask deep
  decisions about when to play bands, which races to collect, and when to sacrifice
  earlier plays to reset the card market.
