# Description
description: |
  A Game of Thrones: The Board Game puts three to six players in command of
  the Great Houses of Westeros — Stark, Lannister, Baratheon, Tyrell, Martell,
  and Greyjoy — all vying to plant their banner on the Iron Throne. Each round
  opens with a bidding phase for influence on three tracks — Iron Throne,
  Fiefdoms, and King's Court — granting tiebreaking priority, combat boosts,
  and support token control. Players simultaneously and secretly choose order
  tokens for each territory they control, then resolve raids, marches, and
  consolidations. Combat is resolved through hand-management of House cards,
  each representing a named character with unique abilities. Diplomatic treachery
  is baked in: players can agree to support each other in battles, but those
  agreements are never binding. The first player to control seven castles and
  strongholds wins, creating a tense race that rewards shifting alliances and
  calculated betrayals.
