# Description
description: |
  Abyss is a visually striking fantasy card game in which players compete to claim
  the throne of the underwater kingdom. To win, players must accumulate Influence
  points by recruiting powerful Lords, controlling key Locations, and earning favor
  from the Council of Allies.

  The game proceeds through three interconnected phases: exploring the Abyss to
  gather Allies (with a push-your-luck bidding mechanic where other players can
  purchase Allies before you do), using those Allies to recruit influential Lords,
  and spending Lords to control underwater territories. Each phase feeds into the
  next in a satisfying loop.

  The push-your-luck element in exploring gives Abyss its tension: do you keep
  drawing Allies hoping to collect a valuable set, or cash out before someone else
  buys what you've revealed? Designed by Bruno Cathala and Charles Chevallier,
  Abyss is celebrated for its gorgeous artwork by Xavier Collette and its
  accessible yet layered gameplay.
