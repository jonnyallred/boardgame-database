# Description
description: |
  Origin Story is a trick-taking game with tableau-building elements for 1-5 players, published
  by Stonemaier Games in 2025. Players craft a superhero or supervillain over five rounds,
  weaving together a character's backstory, gadgets, allies, and grudge against an archenemy,
  culminating in the unleashing of an ultimate ability.

  Each round, players set their alignment — hero or villain — simultaneously and secretly. Heroes
  aim to win as many tricks as possible, scoring one victory point per trick at round's end.
  Villains pursue the opposite goal: winning zero tricks earns them four victory points. Cards
  are divided into four suits (brains, love, speed, and strength), with the highest love card
  automatically trumping cards of any other suit.

  Each round, players choose one of three drawn story cards to add to their character's tableau,
  unlocking permanent powers that compound across rounds and make the character feel increasingly
  capable. Round three introduces a one-off event card that temporarily changes the scoring or
  rules. In round five, each player reveals a previously secret superhero card, gaining its
  special benefit to close out the game.

  Illustrated by Clémentine Campardou (known for Wyrmspan), Origin Story blends the familiarity
  of trick-taking with the satisfying arc of building a superhero narrative, making it accessible
  as a family game while offering meaningful strategic decisions around alignment, card play, and
  ability development.
