# Description
description: |
  A unique deduction game where players are cryptozoologists racing to find
  a hidden creature. Each player holds one secret clue about the creature's
  habitat, and when all clues combine, they identify a single hex on the
  modular board. Ask questions and search locations to deduce opponents'
  clues while concealing your own through honest misdirection. Features
  over 46,000 possible board configurations across two difficulty levels.
