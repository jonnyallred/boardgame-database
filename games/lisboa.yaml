# Description
description: |
  Rebuild the city of Lisboa after the devastating earthquake, tsunami,
  and fires of November 1, 1755. As members of the Portuguese nobility,
  players use a hand of multi-use cards to gain influence with the King,
  the Marquis, and the Builder. Construct public buildings and open shops
  in the new city streets, manage resources, and navigate the political
  landscape of 18th-century Portugal. A deeply interconnected heavy Euro
  from Vital Lacerda with artwork by Ian O'Toole.
