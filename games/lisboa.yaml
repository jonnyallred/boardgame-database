# Description
description: |
  Rebuild Lisbon after the catastrophic 1755 earthquake under the guidance of
  the Marquis of Pombal. Players play cards to take actions—constructing
  buildings, serving nobles, managing the church and court, and rebuilding
  the city grid. Each card has multiple uses, creating agonizing choices about
  timing and efficiency. Noble networks unlock powerful chain actions. The city
  physically reconstructs as the game progresses. Vital Lacerda's most
  acclaimed work: breathtakingly complex, richly historical, and deeply satisfying.
