# Description
description: |
  In The Vale of Eternity, players are tamers who hunt various monsters and spirits to tame them as minions. The game features seventy unique creature cards drawn from myths around the world. Each round consists of three phases: Hunting (draft two cards from the game board), Action (sell cards for crystals, tame creatures to your hand, or summon them to your tableau), and Resolution (use active effects of summoned creatures). Players build powerful combos by collecting sets of creatures and utilizing their synergistic abilities. The tamer who manages to assemble the most outstanding collection of minions wins. Winner of the 2024 Mensa Select Award for original, challenging, and well-designed gameplay.
