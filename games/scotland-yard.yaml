# Description
description: |
  Scotland Yard is a classic hidden movement board game published by Ravensburger in 1983, where one
  player takes the role of the elusive criminal Mr. X while the remaining players cooperate as Scotland
  Yard detectives trying to capture him on the streets of London. The game won the prestigious Spiel des
  Jahres in 1983 — one of the earliest games to incorporate both cooperative and asymmetric play.

  Mr. X moves secretly around the London map using taxi, bus, and underground tokens, occasionally
  surfacing to reveal his location before vanishing again. Detectives must pool their deduction and
  coordinate their movements to corner him. While the detectives can always see which mode of transport
  Mr. X uses, his exact position is only revealed periodically, creating mounting tension as both sides
  try to outmaneuver each other. Scotland Yard is considered a pioneering design in the hidden movement
  genre and remains a beloved family strategy classic.
