# Description
description: |
  Automobile takes three to five players into the cutthroat early American auto
  industry, spanning the period from the 1893 Duryea through the rise of mass
  production. Each of four turns represents a decade, with players purchasing
  factories that produce low-, medium-, or high-end vehicles and funding
  distributors across the country to move their stock. The game's central
  challenge is managing supply against demand: every car produced that goes
  unsold drives a factory into bankruptcy, while underfunding distributors
  collapses their operations. Historical special-action spaces grant one-turn
  abilities tied to real figures like Ford, Durant, and Kettering. Each copy of
  the original Treefrog Line edition was signed and numbered by Wallace, released
  in a limited run of 1500 copies with all-wooden components.
