# Description
description: |
  Arydia: The Paths We Dare Tread is a GM-less cooperative open-world campaign
  board game for 1-4 players set in the richly crafted fantasy world of Arydia.
  Built on four pillars — Exploration, Progression, Combat, and Role-playing —
  the game unfolds across many sessions as players traverse a unique, non-randomized
  world map, uncovering locations, interacting with NPCs, and fighting monsters
  through a tactical directional combat system. Characters grow in power by
  collecting items, weapons, and skills, with an index-based save system enabling
  easy setup and teardown between sessions. As a "green legacy" game, it offers
  all the excitement of a legacy experience — sealed packages, hidden content,
  branching narrative — while remaining fully resettable and replayable after
  completion. Production includes 60+ pre-painted miniatures, 900+ cards, and
  multi-layer world maps across a 40+ hour hand-crafted campaign.
