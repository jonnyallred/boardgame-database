# Description
description: |
  Build railroad empires across a massive map by connecting cities, delivering
  goods, and upgrading your locomotive. Players auction for turn order and
  special actions each round, then lay track across hexes to link cities of
  matching colors with demand. Loans fuel early expansion but cost points at
  game end. Complete secret objectives and build the most profitable network
  to win. A streamlined reimplementation of Martin Wallace's Age of Steam
  with enhanced components and an enormous board.
