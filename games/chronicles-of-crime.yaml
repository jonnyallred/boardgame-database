# Description
description: |
  Chronicles of Crime is an award-winning cooperative game of criminal investigation
  that blends a physical board game with a free companion app and an optional Virtual
  Reality mode. Published by Lucky Duck Games in 2018, the game was designed by David
  Cicurel and funded through Kickstarter.

  Players work together as a team of investigators trying to solve a series of criminal
  cases. Each component — locations, suspects, items, and witnesses — carries a unique
  QR code. Players scan these codes with the app to interrogate characters, examine crime
  scenes, and gather forensic evidence. The app then narrates what the characters say or
  what is found at each location, driving the investigation forward.

  The base game includes one tutorial case and five interconnected scenarios that form a
  larger story arc. Additional free cases can be downloaded directly through the app.
  Specialist cards (doctor, scientist, criminologist, hacker) can be consulted for expert
  analysis of specific evidence types. Sessions conclude when players feel ready to accuse
  a suspect, with their score determined by the time elapsed and any mistakes made.

  A standout feature is the optional VR mode: players can slip their phone into a cardboard
  viewer to explore crime scenes in 360-degree virtual reality. The game won multiple awards
  including the As d'Or at the Festival International des Jeux de Cannes 2019.
