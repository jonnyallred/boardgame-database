# Description
description: |
  A cooperative crime investigation game that blends board gaming with a
  smartphone app and optional VR. Players scan QR codes on location, character,
  and evidence cards to uncover clues, interrogate suspects, and examine crime
  scenes. Multiple standalone scenarios can be played with the same physical
  components, and new cases are added via app updates.
