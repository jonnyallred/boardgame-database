description: |
  Dragon Eclipse is a cooperative campaign game set in a colorful universe inhabited by mystlings —
  element-wielding creatures. Players take on the role of Tamers who befriend and train mystlings,
  building bonds and developing their companions' powers across a campaign. The game combines
  creature-taming mechanics with tactical hex-based combat, light exploration, and deck construction.
  Card-driven mechanics resolve conflicts and narrative choices. In addition to the main cooperative
  campaign, the game supports competitive PvP play and a challenging Roguelite mode, making it
  highly replayable. Published by Awaken Realms (Tainted Grail, Nemesis) with their characteristic
  high production quality, Dragon Eclipse is designed to appeal to both veteran gamers and newcomers
  to the cooperative adventure genre.
