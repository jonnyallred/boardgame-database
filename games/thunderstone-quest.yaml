# Description
description: |
  Thunderstone Quest is a deck-building dungeon crawler published by Alderac Entertainment
  Group in 2018, a reimagining of the original Thunderstone series. Players form parties
  of heroes, equip them with weapons, spells, and magic items, and send them into a
  redesigned modular dungeon to fight terrifying monsters.

  The dungeon system features a significant overhaul, dramatically increasing variability
  and complexity. When a player ventures into the dungeon, they must map out their path
  and choose which monsters to fight, with bonus card draws and penalties creating a
  press-your-luck feel. Guardian Keys hidden throughout the dungeon lead to a climactic
  Final Battle when a complete set is uncovered.

  Thunderstone Quest introduces campaign play with a series of pre-set dungeon tiles,
  monsters, heroes, and support cards, each accompanied by a story booklet that narrates
  progress through interconnected mini-adventures. The game supports 1-4 players and
  features high replayability through its modular setup.
