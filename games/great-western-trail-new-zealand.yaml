# Description
description: |
  The third standalone game in the Great Western Trail trilogy, transporting the
  acclaimed formula to the sheep stations of New Zealand's South Island. Players
  are runholders driving their flocks across vast pastures to shipping ports, using
  the signature deck-building and hand management system of the series. New Zealand
  introduces fresh mechanics including a unique worker progression system and
  terrain-specific challenges that differentiate it from its predecessors. A complete
  standalone game that forms the conclusion to Alexander Pfister's GWT trilogy.
