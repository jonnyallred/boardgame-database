# Description
description: |
  Take on the role of a runholder on the South Island of New Zealand,
  tending sheep and moving along a trail to Wellington. Deliver sheep
  to local or foreign trading posts for victory points. Build your deck,
  construct buildings along the rondel, and shear sheep for profit. The
  heaviest entry in the Great Western Trail trilogy, adding gold panning
  and ship mechanics to the series' signature deck-building core.
