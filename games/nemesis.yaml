# Description
description: |
  Nemesis is a semi-cooperative sci-fi survival horror game for 1-5 players set aboard
  the spaceship Nemesis. Players wake from hibernation to find the ship overrun by
  terrifying alien creatures called Intruders. Each player controls an asymmetric
  character with unique abilities and draws two objective cards at the start — one
  personal, one corporate — choosing one to pursue after the first Intruder appears.
  Because objectives are hidden and may conflict with other players' goals, trust is
  never guaranteed.

  Players must explore a modular ship board, scavenge for resources, complete repairs,
  and find a way back to Earth — all while evading or fighting increasingly dangerous
  Intruders that grow stronger as the game progresses. The alien encounter system uses
  a noise-tracking mechanic: making too much noise draws Intruders to your location,
  creating a constant tension between speed and stealth.

  The game can end with all players winning, some winning, or everyone losing. Solo
  and fully cooperative modes are also available. Nemesis is heavily inspired by the
  Alien film franchise, delivering a cinematic atmosphere of dread and paranoia through
  its high-quality miniatures, emergent storytelling, and player-driven narrative.
  It was funded via Kickstarter in 2018 and became one of the landmark releases for
  Awaken Realms.
