# Description
description: |
  Tiletum is a heavy euro game designed by Simone Luciani and Daniele Tascini, published
  by Board&Dice in 2022. Set during the early Renaissance in Europe, players take on the
  roles of wealthy merchants traveling from the city of Tiletum (modern-day Tielt, Belgium)
  to Venice, pursuing trade and prestige.

  The game's core mechanism is innovative dice management: dice serve a dual function,
  providing both resources and actions. Crucially, the power of an action is inversely
  proportional to the die value — using a low-value die grants a more powerful action but
  fewer resources, while a high-value die yields more resources but a weaker action.

  Players travel to cities to acquire wool and iron trade contracts, establish trade houses,
  collect resources, invest in cathedral construction, gain noble family favor, participate
  in fairs, and recruit notable persons. This multi-path scoring system and the elegant
  tension of the dice mechanic make Tiletum a standout in the designer duo's acclaimed
  catalog.
