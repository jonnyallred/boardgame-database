# Description
description: |
  Travel across Renaissance Europe as a merchant, drafting dice that
  determine both the action you take and the resources you receive in
  an elegant inverse relationship. Manage trade routes, fulfill contracts,
  and build influence across cathedral cities. A crunchy Euro where every
  die selection creates satisfying tradeoffs between actions and resources.
