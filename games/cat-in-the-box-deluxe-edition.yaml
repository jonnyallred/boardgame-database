# Description
description: |
  Cat in the Box is a quantum-themed trick-taking card game built around a brilliantly clever twist: cards have no printed suit, and players declare which suit a card belongs to when they play it. Inspired by Schrödinger's Cat paradox, each card exists in a superposition of suits until the moment it hits the table. Players bid on how many tricks they expect to win, then carefully declare card suits while placing tokens on a shared community research board, earning bonus points for creating large connected groups of tokens. The catch: you cannot declare a suit for a card number that has already been declared in that suit, or you cause a paradox and suffer a penalty. The Deluxe Edition upgrades the original 2020 design with acrylic tokens, recessed player boards and research board, and expanded support for up to five players, making this cult-classic card game more accessible and tactile than ever.
