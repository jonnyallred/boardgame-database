# Description
description: |
  Cat in the Box: Deluxe Edition is a quantum trick-taking card game inspired by the Schrödinger's cat thought experiment. Cards have no inherent color - instead, players declare the color when they play a card, creating a dynamic puzzle of deduction and prediction. Before each hand, players bid on how many tricks they'll win, then place tokens on a shared research board as they play. The twist: you cannot declare the same number-color combination that has already been played, forcing careful planning to avoid creating a paradox. If you create a paradox, you score negative points. The game combines traditional trick-taking with innovative mechanics where red is trump and the color of each card is only determined when played, creating unique strategic depth.
