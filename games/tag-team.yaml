# Description
description: |
  Tag Team is a lightning-fast fighting card game for exactly two players, inspired by
  classic arcade fighting games. Players each choose a team of two asymmetric characters
  from 12 included in the box and battle it out in about 15 minutes.

  The game combines auto-battler mechanics with deck building in a unique way: players
  start with a deck of only two cards, and combat unfolds automatically by flipping cards
  one at a time and applying their effects. At the end of each round, players strategically
  add new cards to program their deck — crucially, without reordering the cards already
  present — creating a puzzle-like planning element.

  With open drafting and card play conflict resolution at its core, Tag Team is available
  on Board Game Arena for online play. Its speed, asymmetric characters, and clever
  deck-building twist make it a standout two-player filler.
