# Description
description: |
  EXIT: The Game is an award-winning series of escape room games in a box,
  designed by husband-and-wife duo Inka and Markus Brand. First published by
  KOSMOS in Germany in 2016 (and in English by Thames & Kosmos), the series
  won the prestigious Kennerspiel des Jahres award in 2017.

  Players work together to solve a series of interlocking riddles, puzzles,
  and logic challenges, racing against the clock to "escape" before time runs
  out. The game is played with a deck of cards, a code dial, and a booklet of
  puzzles — no app required. Each correct solution reveals the next clue,
  building toward a final escape.

  A distinctive feature of the series is that many titles are intentionally
  destructive: players may be required to cut, fold, or write on components
  as part of solving puzzles, making each copy a single-use experience. The
  faster the group escapes and the fewer hints they use, the higher their
  final score.

  Each title in the series features a different setting and difficulty level,
  ranging from "Beginner" to "Expert." Popular entries include The Abandoned
  Cabin, The Secret Lab, The Pharaoh's Tomb, and dozens more. The series is
  widely credited with popularizing the at-home escape room genre in tabletop
  gaming.
