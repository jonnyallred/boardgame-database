# Description
description: |
  A strategy game where one to six players guide the course of history in an
  ancient land. One player rules as the Chancellor while others scheme as loyal
  Citizens or desperate Exiles seeking to topple the empire. The consequences
  of each game ripple into the next, reshaping available resources, actions,
  and even victory conditions -- not through legacy components, but through a
  unique chronicling system that makes every session feel like living history.
