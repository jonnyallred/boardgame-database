# Description
description: |
  Step into the shoes of Sherlock Holmes' Baker Street Irregulars and
  solve ten baffling cases set in Victorian London. Read case introductions,
  follow leads by visiting locations on the included London map, interview
  suspects and witnesses through numbered paragraphs in the case books,
  and piece together clues from period newspapers. A purely deductive
  cooperative experience with no dice or randomness - only your wits
  against the master detective himself. Score points by solving the case
  while visiting fewer locations than Holmes.
