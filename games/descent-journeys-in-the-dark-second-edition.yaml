# Description
description: |
  Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition) is a revised and streamlined version of
  the original 2005 dungeon-crawler, published by Fantasy Flight Games in 2012. One player
  acts as the Overlord, controlling monsters and setting traps, while up to four hero
  players cooperate to complete quests across a campaign. The second edition introduced a
  more focused Quest structure with shorter play sessions, revised hero and monster cards,
  updated dice, and significant improvements to the campaign framework including a new
  app-based companion. Heroes develop skills, equipment, and attributes as they progress
  through linked quests. The Overlord uses a deck-building mechanic with treachery cards
  to bolster monsters and hinder heroes. This edition greatly increased accessibility
  while retaining the rich dungeon-crawl experience of the original.
