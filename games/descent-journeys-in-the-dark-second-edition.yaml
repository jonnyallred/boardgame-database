# Description
description: |
  A dungeon-crawling adventure where one player takes on the role of the
  overlord, controlling monsters and springing traps, while up to four
  other players cooperate as heroes exploring dungeons, fighting monsters,
  and completing quests. The second edition streamlines the rules from the
  original, adding a campaign system where heroes level up and acquire
  new gear across linked scenarios. Features a modular tile-based map,
  custom dice combat, and deep asymmetric gameplay between the overlord
  and hero players. Dozens of expansions add new heroes, classes, monsters,
  and campaign content.
