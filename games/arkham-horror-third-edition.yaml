# Description
description: |
  Arkham Horror (Third Edition) is a cooperative investigation game for one to
  six players set in the eerie Massachusetts town of 1926 Arkham, where eldritch
  horrors from beyond threaten to tear open the fabric of reality. Players take
  on the roles of investigators with unique abilities, exploring the city's
  modular hexagonal neighborhoods across a series of branching narrative
  scenarios. Each investigator can perform two actions per turn — moving, fighting
  monsters, gathering clues, or acquiring items — while the Monster Phase closes in
  with fresh threats. Four standalone scenarios in the base game each reshape the
  board layout and introduce new stakes. Compared to the second edition, the third
  significantly streamlines rules and leans harder into narrative, making it more
  accessible while retaining the cosmic horror tension the series is known for.
