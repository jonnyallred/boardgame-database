# Description
description: |
  Mr. Jack is an asymmetric 2-player deduction game set in London's Whitechapel
  district in 1889. One player secretly plays as Jack the Ripper, disguised as
  one of eight investigators gathered to hunt him down. The other player controls
  all eight characters, trying to deduce which one is Jack before he escapes.

  Each round, players alternate activating characters — moving them around the
  hexagonal board and using their unique special abilities. After each round, Jack
  must announce whether he is in the light (adjacent to a lit lamp post or visible
  to another character) or in the dark. This information, combined with which
  characters were moved and where, allows the investigator to systematically
  eliminate suspects.

  Jack wins by slipping out one of the four exits from the district or by keeping
  his identity hidden for all eight rounds. The investigator wins by correctly
  identifying and arresting Jack in a single accusation, or by blocking all exits.
  The asymmetric information and the tension of each reveal make the game a tense,
  clever cat-and-mouse thriller.
