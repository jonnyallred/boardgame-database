# Description
description: |
  Aqualin is a two-player abstract strategy game played on a 6×6 reef grid with
  36 acrylic tiles depicting six sea creatures in six different colors. Each turn,
  a player selects one of the six available stones and places it on an empty space,
  then optionally moves one adjacent stone before or after placement to form
  groups. The twist: one player scores points for grouping stones by color, while
  the other scores for grouping by creature type. Both players are placing the
  same stones and neither can add new pieces without potentially helping the
  opponent. Larger connected groups score more points, and the player with the most
  points when the board is full wins. This elegant shared-resource tension makes
  Aqualin a satisfying abstract game that plays in under half an hour.
