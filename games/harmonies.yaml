# Description
description: |
  Place colorful animal tokens and terrain tiles to create harmonious natural
  ecosystems. Each round, draft tokens from a shared supply and arrange them
  on your personal board. Animals score based on their habitat preferences—
  bears want forests and mountains, herons need water adjacent to plains, and
  so on. Animal cards reveal unique scoring patterns each game. Stunning
  visual design and gentle complexity make this an outstanding gateway game
  and a worthy successor to Cascadia's nature-drafting niche.
