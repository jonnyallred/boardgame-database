# Description
description: |
  Create dreamlike landscapes by drafting sets of colored tokens from a
  shared central board and placing them on your personal hex grid. Stack
  tokens to build trees and mountains in three dimensions, forming habitat
  patterns that attract animals to your world. Each animal card requires a
  specific terrain arrangement, rewarding spatial planning and forward
  thinking. Winner of the 2024 Golden Geek Medium Game of the Year and
  Spiel des Jahres Recommended.
