# Description
description: |
  Leaf is a cozy nature-themed tile-laying game in which players embody the
  spirit of the wind, guiding falling autumn leaves across the forest floor.
  On each turn, players draft leaf tiles from a central display and place them
  onto their personal forest floor, creating a growing spatial puzzle. Each
  leaf tile section is colour-coded: orange areas grant sunshine tokens used
  to advance the season and collect acorns; green areas let you draw animal
  cards worth end-game points; brown areas let you grow mushrooms; yellow
  areas let you draw more leaf cards; and purple areas advance your squirrel
  up a scoring tree. When a player places a leaf tile adjacent to a mushroom
  token belonging to another player, that player earns a bonus, providing
  light interaction without confrontation. The game ends when the season track
  is exhausted. Players score points from animals, mushrooms, acorns, and
  squirrel position. A well-regarded solo mode is included. Leaf won the
  Origins Award for Best Light Strategy Game and is praised for its accessible
  rules, beautiful artwork, and eco-conscious production using paper bands
  instead of shrink wrap.
