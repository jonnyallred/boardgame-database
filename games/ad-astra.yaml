# Description
description: |
  Ad Astra transports three to five players into a distant future where divergent
  human sub-races compete to colonize the galaxy. The game's central mechanic is
  a hybrid of variable role selection and action programming: each round, players
  simultaneously place action cards face-down on a shared planning board, then
  reveal and resolve them in order. Everyone benefits when any player's chosen
  phase is resolved, creating the Puerto Rico-style dynamic Faidutti has cited
  as inspiration. Players explore modular star systems, extract resources from
  planets, build factories and colonies, and haul goods via spaceships. Ancient
  alien technologies discovered during exploration can swing the balance of power.
  The intersection of simultaneous programming with shared-benefit phase
  resolution makes Ad Astra distinctive in the space-civilization genre.
