# Description
description: |
  An intense team-based submarine warfare game. Two teams of up to 4 sit on
  opposite sides of a divider. Each player takes a specific role—Captain,
  First Mate, Radio Operator, or Engineer—working together to locate and
  destroy the opposing submarine. Can be played turn-by-turn or in real-time
  simultaneous mode for a chaotic, high-pressure experience. Best at 6-8
  players with all roles filled.
