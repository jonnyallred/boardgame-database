# Description
description: |
  Captain Sonar is a real-time team game of submarine warfare for two to eight
  players. Two teams of up to four sit on opposite sides of a divider, each
  crewing their submarine with four specialized roles: Captain plots movement on
  a grid map and calls out the path aloud; Radio Operator tracks the enemy's
  announced movements to deduce their location; Engineer monitors system damage
  and clears malfunctions; First Mate charges weapons like torpedoes, mines, and
  a sonar pulse. Both submarines move and act simultaneously in the default
  real-time mode, creating controlled chaos as teams try to stay organized while
  listening for enemy clues. A turn-by-turn variant accommodates smaller groups.
  The first submarine to score two direct hits wins.
