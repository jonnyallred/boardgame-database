# Description
description: |
  Wayfarers of the South Tigris is a worker-placement and card development game
  set during the Golden Age of Islam, as explorers chart the lands, waterways,
  and skies around the Tigris River in 9th-century Baghdad. Players are
  wayfarers recruiting crew, gathering resources, and journeying across a
  modular map to earn prestige points.

  Dice are used as workers, with each face value determining which action
  spaces a die can occupy. Players develop their tableau of journal cards —
  land, water, and sky — and upgrade their skills to unlock powerful bonuses.
  The game rewards careful planning and efficient multi-use of resources. Part
  of Garphill Games' South Tigris series, it shares thematic and mechanical
  DNA with Raiders of the North Sea and Architects of the West Kingdom.
