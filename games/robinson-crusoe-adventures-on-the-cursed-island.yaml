# Description
description: |
  Cooperative survival adventure on a deserted island. Players take roles
  as castaways — cook, carpenter, explorer, or soldier — using worker
  placement to gather resources, build shelter, explore terrain, and
  fend off wild beasts. Each round brings weather threats, event cards,
  and difficult choices about splitting limited action pawns between
  guaranteed safe actions and risky solo attempts. Eight distinct
  scenarios provide varied objectives beyond mere survival.
