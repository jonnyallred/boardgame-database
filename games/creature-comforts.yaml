# Description
description: |
  Creature Comforts is a cozy dice-placement worker placement game in which players
  control a family of forest animals preparing their dens for winter. Over three
  seasons — Spring, Summer, and Fall — players send family members out to locations
  across the village and forest to gather supplies and trade for comfort items.

  At the start of each round, players roll their two private Family dice, then the
  central Village dice pool is revealed. Players place their four Workers at
  available locations, and then in turn order use a combination of their personal
  Family dice and the shared Village dice to activate those Workers and collect
  resources. Because players commit to locations before seeing all dice results,
  there is a satisfying push-your-luck tension: if your dice don't meet a location's
  requirement, you gain a Lesson token instead — a minor compensation that helps
  you plan better next time.

  Gathered resources are spent on Comfort cards that improve your den and score
  end-game points. A rotating Traveller at the Inn offers bonus objectives each
  round. The family that builds the most comfortable, well-stocked den when winter
  arrives wins. The game supports solo play through an automa system and scales
  smoothly from 1 to 5 players.
