# Description
description: |
  Wir sind das Volk! (meaning "We are the people!") is a two-player card-driven
  game simulating the economic and political rivalry between East and West
  Germany from 1949 to German reunification. One player controls the Federal
  Republic (West Germany) and the other the German Democratic Republic (East
  Germany), each trying to build a more prosperous and stable society — or
  destabilize their opponent.

  Players use cards to build economic production systems, manage population
  unrest, and place political influence. East Germany must cope with the
  structural disadvantages of a planned economy while managing emigration and
  unrest; West Germany must manage its own political pressures. The game captures
  the asymmetric nature of the two states beautifully and rewards deep strategic
  thinking. Highly regarded in the two-player card-driven wargame tradition
  alongside Twilight Struggle and 13 Days.
