# Description
description: |
  Battle for Rokugan is an area-control conquest game set in the Legend of the
  Five Rings universe, where two to five daimyo compete to bring honor to their
  clan by dominating the provinces of Rokugan. Each round, players simultaneously
  draw a hand of six combat tokens, then secretly place them face-down on
  territories they wish to attack or defend. Tokens include forces of varying
  strength, plus special actions like naval raids, diplomacy, and espionage.
  After all tokens are placed, they are revealed and combat resolves by comparing
  strengths. Controlling an entire territory earns its territory card with
  persistent bonuses. The game plays over five rounds, with victory going to the
  player who controls the most territory and honor at game's end.
