# Description
description: |
  Compete as rival sorcerers in a three-year magical tournament across the
  four seasons. Draft nine power cards during the prelude, then roll and
  draft custom season dice each round to gather elemental energy, summon
  familiars and magical items to your tableau, and convert resources into
  crystals. The seasonal resource system makes timing critical, as elements
  shift in rarity and transmutation value with each passing season.
