# Description
description: |
  Betrayal at House on the Hill begins as a cooperative haunted-house exploration
  game and transforms midway through into a one-versus-many confrontation. Players
  collectively build a three-floor gothic mansion tile by tile as their explorers
  roam its rooms, collecting items and triggering omen cards. When enough omens
  accumulate, the Haunt begins: a roll determines which of 50 haunting scenarios
  activates, typically revealing that one player (the traitor) now controls the
  supernatural forces trying to kill the others. Each haunt features unique win
  conditions for both sides. The randomized board, hidden haunt reveal, and
  scenario variety ensure no two games feel alike. The game won a 2004 Gamers'
  Choice Award for Best Board Game and has been followed by a second and third
  edition.
