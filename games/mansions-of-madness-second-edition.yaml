# Description
description: |
  An app-driven cooperative adventure game set in the Arkham Horror universe.
  Players explore haunted mansions and cursed locations, solving puzzles, fighting
  monsters, and unraveling dark mysteries while a companion app manages the map
  revelation, monster behavior, and narrative events. High-quality plastic miniatures
  and immersive atmospheric storytelling make each scenario a unique experience.
  The app eliminates the need for a game master while delivering complex, branching
  narratives across multiple playable scenarios.
