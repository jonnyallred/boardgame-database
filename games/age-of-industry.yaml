# Description
description: |
  Martin Wallace's streamlined redesign of Brass: Lancashire, set during the
  Industrial Revolution. Players are tycoons competing to build the most
  profitable network of cotton mills, factories, iron works, coal mines, ports,
  and railway lines across a double-sided board featuring Germany and southern
  New England. Unlike Brass, there is only a single railway era — the canal
  period has been eliminated — and cards are color-coded to flexible regions
  rather than specific cities, making it easier to execute plans. Only three of
  the seven available actions require spending a card, loans are a free action,
  and players always have face-up cards to choose from, resulting in a more
  accessible experience that serves as an excellent gateway into the Brass
  system.
