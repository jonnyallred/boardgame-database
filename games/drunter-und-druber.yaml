# Description

  Drunter und Drüber (also published in English as "Wacky Wacky West" by Mayfair Games)
  is a tile-placement game with hidden objectives and a clever voting mechanism. It won the
  prestigious Spiel des Jahres award in 1991 and also the Deutscher Spiele Preis that same year.

  Players take on the roles of townspeople in the fabled German city of Schilda, which burned
  down and must be rebuilt. Each player is secretly assigned one of six types of buildings
  (appearing five times each on the board) that they want to preserve. On their turn, players
  place a tile — streets, rivers, or town walls — that can extend across the board, potentially
  covering and demolishing buildings in the process.

  When a tile placement would cover an outbuilding (a building that belongs to one of the secret
  goal types), a vote is triggered. Players use voting cards — ranging from triple votes to double
  votes, single votes, abstentions, and the special "Jeeiin" wild card — to collectively decide
  whether to allow the tile or reject it. Each player must balance voting to protect their own
  secret building type while not revealing too much about which type they hold.

  The player who manages to preserve the most of their secret building type at the end of the
  game wins. The combination of secret objectives, tactical tile placement, and the bluffing-
  rich voting phase creates a highly interactive, laugh-filled experience that remains accessible
  to casual and family players while offering meaningful decisions throughout.
