# Description
description: |
  Metal Gear Solid: The Board Game is a cooperative stealth miniatures game for 1-4 players
  that faithfully adapts Konami's iconic video game franchise. Players take on the roles of
  Solid Snake, Meryl, Gray Fox, and Otacon — each with unique asymmetric abilities — as they
  infiltrate the Shadow Moses nuclear facility across 14 campaign missions that follow the
  original game's story beat-for-beat.

  The core gameplay revolves around stealth. Guards patrol in semi-predictable patterns driven
  by an AI behavior card deck, and players must use cover, line-of-sight mechanics, and
  character-specific skills to avoid detection. Snake specializes in stealth takedowns, Meryl
  can disguise herself to slip past guards unnoticed, Gray Fox starts with his High-Frequency
  Blade, and Otacon brings a unique Hack deck. Being spotted triggers an alert state that
  dramatically increases the danger, forcing players to adapt on the fly.

  Action points govern each player's turn, creating a tight tactical puzzle each round. The
  game also includes 6 standalone VR Missions for quicker play sessions. Originally developed
  by IDW Games and cancelled in 2021, the project was revived by CMON and released in
  January 2025, earning praise for its faithful adaptation of the video game's tension and
  stealth-focused mechanics.
