# Description
description: |
  Players compete to build the most profitable businesses in the heart of
  Chinatown. Each round, players acquire ownership of city block sections
  and business tiles through random distribution. The core of the game is
  free-form negotiation - players can trade anything with anyone to complete
  matching sets of adjacent businesses. Completed businesses generate income,
  with larger sets paying significantly more than smaller ones.
