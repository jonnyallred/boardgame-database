# Description
description: |
  Post-apocalyptic worker placement with a time travel twist. Players lead
  asymmetric factions rebuilding civilization while deploying exosuit-wearing
  workers to gather resources and construct wonders. The signature mechanic:
  borrow resources from your future self to use now, then send resources back
  in time to repay the debt or face a paradox. A ticking countdown ends the
  game as an asteroid approaches. Outstanding production with exosuit miniatures
  available. One of the deepest worker placement games available.
