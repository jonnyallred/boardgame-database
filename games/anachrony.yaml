# Description
description: |
  In a post-apocalyptic 26th century, humanity has reorganized along four
  ideological Paths after a devastating cataclysm. Players lead one of
  these factions, deploying workers in exosuits to gather resources, construct
  buildings, and research technologies. The signature time-travel mechanism
  lets you borrow resources from your future self — but you must eventually
  close the loop or suffer paradoxes. Features a two-tiered worker placement
  system with four specialist types and exosuits required for hazardous
  action spaces. The looming impact event drives urgency across 4-7 eras.
