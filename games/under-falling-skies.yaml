# Description
description: |
  Under Falling Skies is a solo dice-placement game published by Czech Games Edition in
  2020, designed by Tomáš Uhlíř. The game originated from a 9-card print-and-play
  prototype that won multiple categories in BGG's 2019 Print and Play Design Contest —
  including Best Solitaire Game, Most Thematic Game, and Best Overall Game — before
  CGE developed it into a full retail product for Essen 2020.

  Players defend a besieged city against an alien invasion across a multi-mission
  campaign. Each mission features a unique city layout with different buildings providing
  special abilities. On each turn, the player rolls a pool of dice and assigns each to a
  column of the city board — the die's value determines which row it can occupy, and both
  placement and value trigger different building effects.

  The aliens descend each round, and the die placed in the highest column slows their
  mothership's advance, but lower values in that column mean fewer actions. This tension
  between fighting off the enemy and powering base defenses drives every decision.
  Under Falling Skies packs remarkable depth into a solo experience that plays in under
  45 minutes.
