# Description
description: |
  A solo dice placement game where you defend a besieged city against an
  alien invasion. Each turn, assign dice to action spaces in your underground
  base to research technology, shoot down enemy ships, excavate new rooms,
  or deploy robots. Higher-value dice give stronger effects but push enemies
  closer faster. Features a multi-mission campaign with new cities,
  motherships, and story elements.
