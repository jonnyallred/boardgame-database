description: |
  Factory Fun is a real-time tile-laying puzzle game where players simultaneously race to grab
  factory machine tiles and fit them into their personal factory layout. Each machine tile has
  colored input and output pipes that must connect properly to other machines or reservoirs —
  connecting outputs to inputs of matching colors creates more valuable products and earns more
  money. Players grab tiles as fast as they can from a central supply, but must immediately
  decide whether and how to fit them into their factory. Poorly planned connections cost money
  to fix. The simultaneous play creates frantic urgency as players race to claim the best
  machines before opponents grab them, while also solving their personal spatial puzzle.
