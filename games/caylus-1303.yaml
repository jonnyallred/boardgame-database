description: |
  Caylus 1303 is a modernized reimagining of the classic worker placement game Caylus, streamlined
  for faster and more intense play. Players compete as master builders serving the King, placing
  workers in buildings along a road to gather resources, deliver them to the castle, or construct
  new buildings. The classic Caylus mechanisms have been refined and modernized: hidden victory
  points, variable player powers, and a tighter action economy create a more dynamic game than
  its predecessor. The provost — a position that advances or retreats based on player actions —
  still determines which buildings activate each round, creating strategic tension around when
  to advance or block the provost. A worthy successor for both fans of original Caylus and
  newcomers to worker placement games.
