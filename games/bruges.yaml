# Description
description: |
  Set in 15th century Bruges, players assume the role of merchants competing for
  influence, power, and prestige. Each turn involves selecting a multi-use card and
  performing one of six actions: acquire workers, gain money, mitigate threats, build
  canals or houses, or hire characters depicted on the cards. Card colors and dice
  rolls determine action effectiveness and introduce threats that must be managed.
  The game combines hand management, dice mitigation, and tableau building as players
  build their merchant empires and accumulate victory points.
