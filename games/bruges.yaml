# Description
description: |
  Bruges transports two to four players to the flourishing 15th-century Flemish
  city, where they compete as merchants seeking influence, power, and status
  while the city faces dramatic threats. The game's elegant core mechanic gives
  every card six possible uses: spend it to build canals, hire workers, construct
  buildings, place townspeople, gain gold, or protect against threats. Dice rolled
  at the start of each round determine the current cost of hiring workers and the
  active threats that must be addressed. The city's unique characters — each an
  asymmetric historical figure — provide special powers that fuel emergent
  strategy. Nominated for the Kennerspiel des Jahres, Bruges was Stefan Feld's
  first game to prominently feature multi-use cards and is regarded as one of
  the best examples of the mechanism in the hobby.
