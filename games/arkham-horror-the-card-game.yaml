# Description
description: |
  A cooperative Living Card Game set in H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, where one to four
  investigators explore the shadowy streets of Arkham to unravel arcane conspiracies before
  ancient evil overwhelms the world. Each player builds a 30-card deck around a chosen
  investigator, drawing cards from five class archetypes (Guardian, Seeker, Rogue, Mystic,
  Survivor) that define their strengths, weaknesses, and role in the group.

  The core mechanic revolves around skill tests resolved by drawing tokens from a "chaos bag"
  filled with modifiers ranging from benign boosts to catastrophic curses. Investigators
  gather clues, fight monsters, and manage two threat tracks — health and sanity — as the
  Mythos deck spawns enemies and crisis events each round.

  Scenarios link together into narrative campaigns where choices carry forward: investigators
  can be killed or driven insane, and trauma, story achievements, and earned experience points
  persist between sessions, allowing players to upgrade their decks. The included "Night of
  the Zealot" campaign spans three interconnected scenarios. Expansions vastly expand the
  available campaigns, investigators, and player cards in the Living Card Game (fixed-
  distribution, non-randomized) format.

  The base core set supports 1-2 players fully; a second core set enables 3-4 players.
  Community consensus favors 2-player and solo play as the optimal counts, where scenario
  pacing and skill-test scaling feel best calibrated.
