description: |
  Guild Ball is a tabletop miniature sports game set in a pseudo-historical fantasy world where
  medieval guilds compete in brutal mob football. Each player commands a team of six players
  drawn from different guilds — Brewers, Blacksmiths, Butchers, and many more — each with
  unique stats and special abilities on their character cards. Teams combine tactical positioning,
  resource management through momentum, and strategic use of special abilities to score goals
  and take out opponents. The game blends sports strategy with miniature wargame depth, rewarding
  mastery of individual guild synergies and adaptive in-game decision-making. Originally crowdfunded
  in 2014 and released in 2015, Guild Ball attracted a devoted competitive community with regular
  tournaments and an evolving roster of playable guilds.
