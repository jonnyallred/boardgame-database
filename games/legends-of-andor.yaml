# Description
description: |
  Legends of Andor is a cooperative fantasy adventure board game in which two to four
  players take on the roles of heroes — a dwarf, an archer, a wizard, and a warrior —
  defending the realm of Andor from invading monster hordes. Each hero has unique
  abilities, and players must coordinate carefully to both complete story-driven quests
  and keep enemies from overwhelming the land's castles.

  The game unfolds across five distinct legend scenarios (plus a sixth player-created
  scenario), each telling a chapter of Andor's ongoing story. A clever narrative
  framework reveals new rules and plot elements only as they become relevant, easing new
  players into the game without front-loading the full rulebook. Enemy creatures advance
  automatically each round via a fate track, creating constant pressure: heroes who
  spend too much time fighting may neglect critical quest objectives, making time
  management as important as combat prowess.

  Designed and illustrated entirely by Michael Menzel, Legends of Andor won the
  Kennerspiel des Jahres 2013 (Connoisseur Game of the Year in Germany) as well as
  multiple European game-of-the-year awards that same year, including Spain's Juego del
  Ano 2013 and France's As d'or 2013. Originally published in German as Die Legenden
  von Andor in 2012, it has since spawned several expansions and sequels, becoming a
  landmark in accessible cooperative adventure gaming.
