# Description
description: |
  Lead your Viking clan to glory before Ragnarok consumes the world.
  Over three ages, draft cards to upgrade your clan, deploy warriors
  and monsters onto the map, and battle rivals for control of provinces.
  Each age ends with Ragnarok destroying a region, sending forces to
  Valhalla. Multiple paths to victory: dominate territories, win
  battles, fulfill quests, or even embrace glorious defeat. The draft
  phase drives strategy as players choose upgrades, combat cards, and
  quest objectives that shape their approach each age.
