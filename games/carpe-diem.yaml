# Description
description: |
  Carpe Diem casts one to four players as wealthy patricians in ancient Rome,
  competing to build the most prosperous city district. Each round, players draft
  district tiles from a central display using an area-movement mechanism, placing
  them into a personal 4×4 grid to create contiguous districts of matching types:
  fields, ponds, forests, and buildings. Completed districts score points and
  provide resources for fulfilling contract cards, which offer substantial bonus
  points when satisfied. The game's four rounds play quickly, and the restricted
  drafting pool forces players to adapt their district plans in response to what
  remains available. Part of the Alea Big Box series, Carpe Diem combines Stefan
  Feld's signature point-salad multi-path scoring with a clean, accessible
  ruleset playable in under an hour.
