# Description
description: |
  Innovation is a civilization-building card game in which players race through ten ages
  of human history, from the Stone Age through the Modern Era, using cards that represent
  humanity's great ideas, technologies, and inventions. Each card belongs to an age and
  carries a unique Dogma effect that can help build your society, score achievements, or
  attack opponents.

  The central mechanic is "splaying" — fanning out your tableau of cards in a direction
  (left, right, or up) to expose additional resource icons on cards beneath the top one.
  Controlling more icons than opponents lets you execute powerful Demand effects that
  force them to give up cards or resources. Players win by claiming Achievements, earned
  either by accumulating score points and accessing high-age cards, or by meeting special
  card conditions.

  Innovation is renowned for its wild card interactions, chaotic swings, and deeply
  asymmetric play. Each of the 105 cards has a completely unique effect, making the game
  a dense puzzle of combos and counter-plays. It won the 2010 Golden Geek Award for Best
  Card Game and is considered a cult classic for players who enjoy high-complexity card
  games with emergent, unpredictable gameplay.
