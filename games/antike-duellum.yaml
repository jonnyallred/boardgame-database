# Description
description: |
  Antike Duellum is a two-player reimagining of Mac Gerdts' Antike, distilling
  the civilization-building rondel game into a tight head-to-head duel. Two
  historical scenarios frame the conflict: the Punic Wars (Rome vs. Carthago) and
  the Persian Wars (Greeks vs. Persians). Both players share the same rondel
  action selector, choosing how far to advance their marker to take actions like
  building cities, training legions, sailing galleys, or researching technologies.
  Combat remains deterministic — no dice, units simply cancel each other —
  maintaining pure strategic focus. The victory condition mirrors Antike: collect
  nine ancient personages through military and scientific achievements. The
  two-player format creates sharper tension than the multi-player original, with
  every rondel decision potentially telegraphing strategy to an attentive opponent.
