# Description
description: |
  Thurn and Taxis is a route-building game for 2-4 players designed by Andreas and Karen Seyfarth,
  winner of the 2006 Spiel des Jahres. Set in 18th century Bavaria and the Holy Roman Empire,
  players build postal route networks to connect cities across a map of Central Europe,
  representing the historical Thurn und Taxis family who operated a real postal empire. Each
  turn, players draw route cards, extend their postal routes by connecting adjacent cities, and
  eventually complete and score routes of increasing length. Completed routes earn post office
  tokens placed across the map, and bonuses are awarded for covering entire regions or building
  the longest networks. The game rewards efficient planning and timing — routes must be at least
  three cities long to score, and knowing when to complete a short route versus extending further
  for a bigger payoff is the central strategic tension. Its clean mechanics and accessible
  theme make it a perennial gateway Euro recommendation.
