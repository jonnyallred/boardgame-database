# Description
description: |
  Build a medieval landscape by drawing and placing tiles featuring cities,
  roads, monasteries, and fields. Deploy your limited supply of meeples to
  claim features and score points when they are completed. Balancing when
  to place meeples and when to hold them back is the core tension. Winner
  of the 2001 Spiel des Jahres. A quintessential gateway game that scales
  from casual family play to competitive tile counting.
