# Description
description: |
  The Settlers of Catan (now known simply as Catan) is one of the most influential board games
  ever published, credited with bringing European-style strategy games to a global mainstream
  audience. Designed by Klaus Teuber and first published in Germany in 1995, players race to
  build settlements, cities, and roads across a modular hex-tile island, earning resources
  (wool, lumber, brick, grain, ore) whenever the dice activate their settlements' adjacent
  terrain. Trading with other players is central — you'll negotiate, bluff, and make deals to
  get what you need. The robber mechanic adds take-that tension when a seven is rolled. Victory
  points accumulate through buildings, longest road, largest army, and special cards, with the
  first player to 10 points winning. Winner of the Spiel des Jahres and Deutscher Spiele Preis
  in 1995, Catan has sold over 40 million copies worldwide and remains the quintessential
  gateway game that defined modern hobby gaming.
