# Description
description: |
  Lead a tribe through the Stone Age, gathering resources, building huts,
  and advancing civilization. Players place workers at various locations to
  collect wood, brick, stone, and gold, hunt for food, develop tools, grow
  their population, and construct buildings. Dice determine resource yields,
  but tools and strategy mitigate luck. A classic gateway worker placement
  game with an accessible theme and satisfying engine-building arc.
