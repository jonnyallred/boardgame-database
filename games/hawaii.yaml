description: |
  Hawaii is a worker placement and tile placement game where players take on the roles of chiefs
  competing to build the most prosperous Polynesian villages. Players use their chieftain pieces
  to travel around the board purchasing island tiles — beaches, grasslands, and forest — and
  adding them to their growing archipelago. Tiles must connect in valid ways and certain tile
  combinations unlock scoring bonuses. Additional island tiles can be explored as the game
  progresses, offering different resource combinations. The game features a variable market
  where tile prices change based on demand, creating strategic purchasing decisions. Points
  are earned through village expansion, collecting cultural artifacts, and completing territory
  objectives, with the most prosperous chief winning at game end.
