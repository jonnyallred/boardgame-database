# Description
description: |
  Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation is an asymmetric two-player game in which one player
  controls the Fellowship of the Ring and the other commands the forces of Sauron. Inspired
  by Stratego, the game adds substantial depth through hidden identities, character-specific
  abilities, and a card-based combat system.

  Each side fields nine characters whose identities remain hidden from the opponent, placed
  in plastic stands on a map of Middle-earth. On their turn, a player moves a piece forward;
  if it enters a space occupied by an enemy, combat is triggered. Both players secretly
  select a combat card, then reveal simultaneously — cards can boost strength, cancel the
  enemy's card, or produce special effects that override raw power.

  The Fellowship player wins by guiding Frodo across the map into Mordor. The Shadow player
  wins by eliminating Frodo or by moving three of their characters into the Shire. Each
  character has a unique special ability (Gandalf defeats any enemy he retreats from,
  Balrog kills any Fellowship character it fights), so bluffing about which piece is which
  is central to victory.

  Designed by Reiner Knizia and published by Fantasy Flight Games, the game is widely
  regarded as one of the finest two-player abstracts built on a thematic chassis — a
  worthy successor to Stratego with meaningful decisions and dramatic swings throughout
  its brief playing time.
