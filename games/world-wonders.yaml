# Description
description: |
  World Wonders is a tile-placement city-building game where players construct
  ancient cities centered on the Seven Wonders of the World. Each round, players
  spend gold to buy tiles that develop their city's economy, placing five types
  of buildings that generate resources and points. The goal is to accumulate the
  most victory points by building a well-planned, efficient city.

  Players must manage resources, population, and spatial layout as their
  settlement grows from a humble village into a sprawling civilization. Wonder
  tokens placed on completed monuments earn bonus victory points. The game is
  praised for its clean, accessible rules and satisfying tile-placement puzzle,
  making it an approachable Euro experience with enough depth to reward
  repeated play.
