# Description
description: |
  One player controls a rogue psychic agent moving secretly across the city
  while the other players work as a team of recruits trying to track them down.
  Based on Matt Kindt's comic series, the game features a brilliant hidden
  movement system with an innovative shift mechanism that gradually balances
  the game over repeated plays.
