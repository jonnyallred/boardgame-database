# Description
description: |
  Hare and Tortoise is a racing game with a sharp twist: instead of rolling dice to move,
  players pay carrots (units of energy) to advance along the track. The further you move in
  a single turn, the more carrots it costs — moving one space costs 1 carrot, but moving
  ten spaces costs 55. You start with 65 carrots, just enough to plod home one square at
  a time, or to sprint in a few costly bursts.

  Scattered along the track are special squares: hare squares (draw a card — could be good
  or bad), tortoise squares (move backward to gain carrots), lettuce squares (rest to lose
  a lettuce card), and number squares (gain carrots based on your position in the race).
  To finish, you must arrive at the home square with no more than 10 carrots remaining and
  all three of your lettuce cards discarded. Timing when to sprint, when to hold back, and
  how to manage your lettuce obligations is the heart of the game.

  Designed by David Parlett and first published in Britain by Intellect Games in 1974,
  Hare and Tortoise became the inaugural winner of the Spiel des Jahres award in 1979
  when Ravensburger released the German edition as "Hase und Igel". It has since sold
  millions of copies in over a dozen languages. The game is celebrated as a pioneering
  design that replaced pure luck with resource management in a racing context, making it
  one of the earliest and most enduring examples of the Euro game philosophy.
