# Description
description: |
  A worker placement game set in the Mayan civilization, driven by five
  interlocking gears that rotate every round. Workers placed on earlier
  (smaller) gear teeth yield fewer resources but free up sooner; those left
  on longer gain compounding benefits as the gears turn. Players build
  buildings, advance on tech tracks, and perform religious ceremonies to score
  points. The gear mechanism creates a uniquely tangible sense of time and
  planning depth.
