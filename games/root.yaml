# Description
description: |
  An asymmetric game of woodland might and right. Two to four players compete
  for control of a vast forest, each with unique abilities and victory
  conditions. The Marquise de Cat wants to build and industrialize, the Eyrie
  Dynasties seek to reclaim their birthright, the Woodland Alliance fights
  for freedom, and the Vagabond plays all sides. Based on COIN-style wargames.
