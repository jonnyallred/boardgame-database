# Description
description: |
  Recruit dwarven warriors to build the mightiest battalion and defeat the
  dragon Fafnir. Each round, players simultaneously bid coins on taverns
  to draft dwarf cards across five classes, each with unique scoring methods.
  Bidding zero lets you upgrade your other coins, creating an escalating
  economy. Collect sets to recruit powerful heroes and dominate the final
  scoring.
