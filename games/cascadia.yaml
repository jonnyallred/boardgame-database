# Description
description: |
  Build a thriving ecosystem in the Pacific Northwest by drafting hexagonal
  habitat tiles and pairing them with wildlife tokens. Each turn, select a
  tile-token pair from a shared display to expand your landscape of forests,
  wetlands, rivers, mountains, and prairies. Score points for creating the
  largest contiguous groups of each habitat type and for arranging bears,
  salmon, hawks, elk, and foxes into species-specific patterns. Winner of
  the 2022 Spiel des Jahres.
