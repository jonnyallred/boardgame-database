# Description
description: |
  Ready Set Bet brings the excitement of horse racing to your table as players head to the track for a day of betting on dice-controlled horses. In this real-time party game, you don't control any of the horses—they move based on dice rolls—so instead you compete to place bets during each chaotic race. Over four rounds, players frantically place their bet tokens on various outcomes while the race unfolds, then collect winnings or suffer losses before receiving VIP Club Cards that provide special betting advantages in subsequent races. The game combines simple rules with fast-paced execution, creating an energetic atmosphere where quick thinking and probability assessment matter more than deep strategy. Winner of the 2023 Golden Geek Award for Best Party Game, Ready Set Bet scales from 2-9 players but truly shines with larger groups where competition for betting spots intensifies the excitement.
