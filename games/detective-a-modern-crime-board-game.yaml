# Description
description: |
  A fully cooperative, immersive detective experience where players work as
  members of the Antares National Investigation Agency. Five interconnected
  cases form a campaign that requires managing limited time, following leads,
  and using an online database to piece together clues. The game uniquely
  encourages "breaking the fourth wall" by allowing players to search the
  real internet for additional information to help solve cases.
