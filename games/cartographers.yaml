# Description
description: |
  Cartographers: A Roll Player Tale is a flip-and-write game for one to over a
  hundred players in which Queen Gimnax charges each player with mapping the
  northern reaches of the realm. Each round, a Explore card is revealed showing
  one or two polyomino terrain shapes — forests, farmland, villages, rivers, or
  wastelands — that every player simultaneously draws onto their personal map
  sheet. Four changing seasons bring different scoring edicts rewarding different
  land configurations, while Ambush cards introduce monster shapes that players
  must place on a neighbor's map to inflict negative points. The game was
  nominated for the 2020 Kennerspiel des Jahres for its tactical depth,
  replayability through variable edict combinations, and elegant accessibility.
