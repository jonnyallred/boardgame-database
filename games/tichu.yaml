# Description
description: |
  A partnership climbing card game for exactly four players in two teams.
  Players try to shed all their cards first, using combinations like pairs,
  straights, and full houses, while supporting their partner across the
  table. Features special cards like the Dragon, Phoenix, and Mahjong that
  add strategic depth. A modern classic that blends Bridge-style teamwork
  with fast card play.
