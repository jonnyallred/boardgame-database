# Description
description: |
  Set in ancient Rome during the reign of Emperor Trajan, players manage
  six areas of Roman life: military, trade, construction, the forum,
  the senate, and Trajan tiles. The central mechanism is a personal
  mancala bowl where players distribute colored cylinders to select
  actions. Matching specific color combinations on bowls unlocks powerful
  Trajan tiles for bonus points and abilities. Players must also
  collectively satisfy the demands of the people each quarter or lose
  points. A deep, strategic Euro with interlocking scoring systems.
