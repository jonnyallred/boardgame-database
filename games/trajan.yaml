# Description
description: |
  Trajan is a heavy euro game designed by Stefan Feld, originally published in 2011 by
  Ammonit Spieleverlag and later by Capstone Games. Set in ancient Rome around 110 AD,
  players compete to score victory points by seizing opportunities across six distinct
  tactical areas: building, trading, the forum, military, the Senate, and placing
  special Trajan tiles.

  The game's defining feature is its mancala-style action selection mechanism. Each player
  has a personal rondel of six bowls containing colored pieces; on each turn, a player
  scoops pieces from one bowl and distributes them one per bowl clockwise, then takes the
  action of the bowl where the last piece lands. If the pieces in that bowl match the
  colors shown on an adjacent Trajan tile, the player also triggers that tile's bonus.

  Planning ahead in this mancala system — setting up future turns while denying opponents
  opportunities — is the game's central challenge. Trajan tiles are placed at game start
  and acquired through play, allowing players to customize their action chains. A favorite
  among fans of deep euro designs, Trajan is widely regarded as one of Stefan Feld's
  finest works.
