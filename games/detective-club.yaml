# Description
description: |
  Detective Club is a social deduction party game for 4-8 players in which each
  round one player acts as the Informer, secretly writing a clue word into most
  players' notebooks — all except one person, the Conspirator. Every player then
  plays two illustrated cards from their hand and offers a brief explanation of
  how their cards relate to the secret word. The Conspirator, who does not know
  the word, must bluff convincingly while picking up on context clues from the
  others' explanations.

  After all cards are played, players discuss the round and vote on who they
  believe the Conspirator is. Detectives who correctly identify the Conspirator
  score 3 points. If the Conspirator escapes detection (fewer than 2 votes
  against them), both the Conspirator and the Informer earn points instead.
  Games last several rounds until scores are tallied.

  Designed by Oleksandr Nevskiy — also known for co-designing Mysterium —
  Detective Club blends the creative card-association of picture-based party
  games with the social pressure of hidden-role deduction. Its simple ruleset
  and broad illustrated card deck make it highly accessible for casual groups
  and families.
