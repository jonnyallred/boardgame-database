# Description
description: |
  The Lord of the Rings: Fate of the Fellowship is a cooperative board game for 1-5 players
  designed by Matt Leacock, published by Z-Man Games in 2025. Each player controls two of 13
  possible characters from the Fellowship (plus a few allies), lending their unique abilities
  to protect Frodo, battle enemies in pivotal locations, and evade the menacing Nazgul.

  On your turn you take up to four actions with one hero and one action with the other.
  Players must coordinate their movements and abilities carefully to complete objectives
  before Sauron's forces overwhelm them. A shared Hope tracker represents the Fellowship's
  morale — if rising Despair drives it to zero, the players lose immediately.

  The game features 24 different objectives, 14 event cards, and 13 playable characters,
  ensuring high replayability with fresh strategic challenges every session. Set collection
  is central to the design: gathering matching card sets is required for key actions, and
  cards can be traded between characters sharing a location. The game includes a dedicated
  solo mode and is considered Matt Leacock's most mechanically rich Pandemic System design
  to date.
