# Description
description: |
  Build your estate in medieval Burgundy. Roll dice to take tiles from a
  central depot and place them in your territory. Different regions score
  differently - complete them quickly for bonus points. A classic Stefan
  Feld point-salad design that uses dice in a strategic rather than
  luck-dependent way.
