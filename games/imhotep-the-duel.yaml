# Description
description: |
  Imhotep: The Duel is a standalone 2-player version of the Spiel des Jahres-nominated
  Imhotep: Builder of Egypt (2016). Players take on the roles of Nefertiti and Akhenaten,
  competing to build the most glorious monuments in ancient Egypt.

  Each round, players place their meeples on a 3x3 grid bordered by boats on two sides.
  A meeple's position on the grid determines which boats it is aligned with. When two or
  more workers are aligned with a boat, either player may unload it, distributing the
  stone tiles aboard to players according to their workers' positions in the line. Workers
  are then cleared from the board.

  Collected tiles are placed onto one of four monument boards — pyramid, obelisk, burial
  chamber, or temple — each scoring points differently. A fifth set of tokens provides
  bonus actions. After three rounds, players total their fame points across all monuments,
  and the player with the most points wins.

  The game distills the feel of the original Imhotep into a tight 20-30 minute duel,
  requiring players to anticipate their opponent's boat unloading choices and carefully
  position their meeples to claim the most valuable tiles. It received a "Recommended"
  nomination from the Spiel des Jahres jury in 2019.
