# Description
description: |
  Zooloretto is the 2007 Spiel des Jahres winner, a family drafting game where
  players build and manage their own zoo. Each turn, players either add tiles
  to the face-down delivery trucks circling the track, or claim a truck and add
  its tiles (animals and money crates) to their zoo enclosures.

  The key tension is that once you claim a truck, your turn is over for that
  round — the earlier you grab a truck, the fewer tiles it may have, while
  waiting risks someone else taking the truck you want. Animal tiles score
  points when you fill an enclosure, but overflow animals that won't fit cost
  negative points. Money lets you buy animals from other players or expand
  your zoo. A clean, elegant design that captures the feel of building a
  thriving zoo through smart tile management.
