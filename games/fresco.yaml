# Description
description: |
  Fresco is a worker placement game published by Queen Games in 2010 in which players
  are Renaissance master painters competing to restore a cathedral fresco. Each morning,
  players secretly set their wake-up time, which determines turn order but also worker
  mood — waking early gives action priority but makes workers grumpy, requiring more money
  to keep them happy. During the day, players send apprentices to the market to buy paints,
  mix colors, paint segments of the fresco, and perform other actions. Painting the fresco
  earns victory points based on the colors used and positions completed, while also
  potentially pleasing the Bishop for bonus scoring. The game features a modular design
  with nine expansion modules included in the box, allowing players to add complexity
  and variety as they become more familiar with the base game.
