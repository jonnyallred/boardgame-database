# Description
description: |
  Massive Darkness 2: Hellscape is a cooperative dungeon-crawling miniatures game for 1 to 6
  players in which heroes descend into a demon-infested underworld, battling monsters and
  collecting loot across 10 included scenarios. A complete redesign of the original Massive
  Darkness, the game incorporates multiple distinct mechanisms drawn from across the hobby —
  push-your-luck, rondel, bag-building, and resource management — each tied to a different
  hero class to give every character a genuinely unique play style.

  Each round follows four phases: Hero Phase (3 actions per hero), Enemy Phase, Level Up
  Phase, and Darkness Phase. Heroes fight on light and shadow tiles, with positional bonuses
  reflecting the game's thematic tension between light and dark. As heroes gain experience
  they unlock new abilities, while monsters simultaneously grow more powerful at level
  milestones. The Darkness Phase spawns reinforcements and new treasures, maintaining
  pressure without acting as a strict timer.

  Hero classes include the Rogue (draws tokens from a personal bag), the Berserker (builds
  rage from damage taken), the Ranger (manages a deck of arrow cards with burst potential),
  and the Mage (rotates an action wheel to sequence spells). Custom skill cards and a
  deep equipment system mean loadouts differ substantially between sessions.

  Components include 62 detailed enemy miniatures, 8 double-sided dungeon tiles, over 250
  item and monster cards, 18 dice, and a cloth loot bag. CMON has released additional free
  scenarios for download. The game was originally funded through Kickstarter and delivered
  in 2022.
