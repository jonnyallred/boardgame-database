# Description
description: |
  FlipToons is a fast-playing small-box deck-building card game set in the animated world of Flip Valley,
  where players compete as rival talent agents assembling the perfect cast for the next great cartoon show.
  The game blends classic deck-building with a distinctive flip mechanic: on your turn, you shuffle your
  personal deck and flip cards into a six-card grid (two rows of three columns), then score fame points
  based on the characters and combinations that land face-up.

  Fame points are the currency of the game — spend them to recruit colorful new character cards from a
  shared market row or pay to purge weak cards from your deck. Once any player crosses 30 fame points,
  everyone takes one final turn and performs a climactic Final Flip; the player with the highest total
  wins. The grid-based scoring creates satisfying push-your-luck moments, as the random flip order means
  even a well-built deck can produce unexpected results. The nostalgic cartoon art style and quick play
  time make FlipToons an accessible entry point for deck-building newcomers while offering enough
  optimization for experienced players. A free Big Button mini-expansion was included with copies purchased
  directly from the publisher.
