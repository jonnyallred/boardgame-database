# Description
description: |
  Catapult Feud is a two-player dexterity game of castle destruction and siege
  warfare. Each player builds a defensive castle from 32 bricks, protects it with
  5 troop pawns, and then takes turns launching rubber boulders from a physical
  catapult to knock down the opponent's fortifications and eliminate their troops.
  Each turn divides into four phases: Tactics (play an action card for a special
  effect), Aim (position the catapult), Fire (launch a boulder), and Cleanup
  (tidy dislodged pieces). The last player to have surviving troops wins. With
  71 physical components including two actual working catapults, the game delivers
  satisfying tactile gameplay accessible to children and adults alike, rewarding
  aiming skill and clever tactical card play.
