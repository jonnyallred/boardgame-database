# Description
description: |
  Set in West Francia circa 900 AD, players take on the role of noble
  paladins defending outlying townships from outsiders. Each round,
  enlist the help of a specific Paladin and gather workers to carry out
  tasks. Build outposts and fortifications, commission monks, and
  confront outsiders to earn victory points. Features a unique blend of
  worker placement with six different worker types, hand management
  through a personal deck of Paladin cards, and engine building as you
  develop your player board. The heaviest entry in the West Kingdom
  trilogy.
