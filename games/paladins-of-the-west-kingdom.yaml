# Description
description: |
  Lead a band of paladins to defend a medieval kingdom from invaders while
  building up your city through worker placement and hand management. Each
  round players place workers at shared locations to gather resources, construct
  buildings, and recruit townsfolk — but each worker also carries a card that
  provides the action's benefits. Track three virtue tracks (strength, piety,
  and influence) alongside silver and provisions to unlock powerful bonuses.
  Part of the West Kingdom trilogy alongside Architects and Raiders.
