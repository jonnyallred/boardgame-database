# Description
description: |
  Arboretum is a tense hand management and card placement game for 2-4 players in
  which players compete to cultivate the most beautiful garden paths through their
  arboretum. Each turn a player draws two cards, plays one to their garden grid,
  and discards one — but the discarded cards go face-up where opponents can take
  them.

  The scoring is deliciously cutthroat: to count the points in a path of a given
  tree species, you must have the highest-valued cards of that species in hand at
  game's end. This creates a core tension — the cards you play to build your paths
  are cards you no longer hold, and holding cards means fewer plays. Meanwhile,
  discarding valuable cards feeds opponents while keeping them out of your hand.

  Arboretum's small footprint, quick play, and elegant artwork by Beth Sobel have
  made it a beloved filler, particularly strong at two players where the hand
  management decisions hit hardest. It rewards careful attention to what opponents
  are collecting.
