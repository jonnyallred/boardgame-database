# Description
description: |
  Legends of Andor is a cooperative adventure board game in which two to four heroes
  must work together to defend the fantasy realm of Andor from invading hordes. The
  game is driven by a series of five unique scenarios (Legends) that tell an
  overarching story as players advance through the campaign.

  Each Legend presents different objectives: heroes might need to slay a specific
  creature, escort a character to safety, or prevent enemies from reaching the castle.
  The tension comes from a clever time-pressure mechanic — a narrative track advances
  whenever heroes move, meaning players must prioritize ruthlessly between fighting
  monsters, exploring, and completing legend objectives.

  Heroes each have distinct abilities and can grow stronger through combat and
  exploration, but dawdling is dangerous. Legends of Andor won the Spiel des Jahres
  Kennerspiel prize in 2013 and is praised for elegantly weaving narrative and
  strategy into a family-friendly cooperative experience.
