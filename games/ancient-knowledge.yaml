# Description
description: |
  Ancient Knowledge is a tableau-building card game in which players race to
  erect monuments and craft artifacts, passing accumulated wisdom down through
  the ages before it is lost to time. On each turn, players draft cards to
  build their civilization, but constructed elements are ephemeral: structures
  gradually decline and disappear unless preserved, mirroring how ancient
  knowledge fades without effort to maintain it. Managing the decay cycle is
  the heart of the design, as players must balance aggressive expansion against
  the cost of preservation. End-game bonuses reward completed sets and
  synergistic tag combinations. The decline mechanic creates a distinctive
  push-pull dynamic absent from most engine-builders.
