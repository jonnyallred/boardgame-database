# Description
description: |
  Abalone is a two-player abstract strategy game played on a hexagonal board
  with 14 black and 14 white marbles. Players take turns pushing one to three
  of their marbles in a straight line, using the "sumito" rule to push opponent
  marbles off the edge when they outnumber them in that line. The first player
  to push six of their opponent's marbles off the board wins. Simple to learn
  but deep in strategic possibility, Abalone rewards pattern recognition and
  forward planning, and has sold over 4.5 million copies since its 1990 debut.
  It received one of the first Mensa Select awards the year of its publication.
