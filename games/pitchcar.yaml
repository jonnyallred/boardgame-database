# Description
description: |
  PitchCar is a dexterity racing game in which players flick wooden disc "cars"
  around a modular wooden track they assemble before the race. The base set
  includes 16 wooden track pieces — straights and curves — that can be combined
  into a wide variety of circuit layouts totalling roughly 3.9 metres in length.
  Each player places their car at the start and takes turns flicking it with a
  finger; any car that flies off the track must be returned to its previous
  position. The first player to complete the agreed number of laps wins.

  Originally designed by Jean du Poël and published in France by Ferti in 1995,
  the game is renowned for its beautiful all-wood construction. It supports 2–8
  players and is accessible to children as young as 6, making it one of the most
  universally enjoyed dexterity games. Nine expansions add tight curves,
  crossroads, jumps, loops, long straights, and other track elements, greatly
  expanding the possible circuit designs. Eagle-Gryphon Games distributes the
  game in North America.
