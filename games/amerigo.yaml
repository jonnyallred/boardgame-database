# Description
description: |
  Amerigo is a strategic exploration game by Stefan Feld in which players help
  Amerigo Vespucci explore the islands of South America, securing trading routes
  and building settlements to earn prestige points.

  The game's defining feature is its cube tower — a tall structure with interior
  baffles that catches and releases colored cubes. At the start of each round,
  cubes are poured in, and the cubes that fall out determine which of seven action
  types are available: movement, building, trading, piracy defense, and more.
  Cubes retained in the tower may surprise players by falling out in later rounds,
  adding a planning-under-uncertainty element.

  On a modular island board, players race to explore, build settlements, and control
  the most lucrative territories. Trading posts generate ongoing income while good
  positioning on the map earns end-game scoring bonuses. Amerigo offers classic
  Feld multi-path scoring within a charming Age of Exploration theme.
