# Description
description: |
  Rival stage illusionists compete for fame and fortune in the Victorian steampunk
  city of Magoria. Players simultaneously program their workers' movements through the
  city each round, dispatching assistants to learn tricks, gather components, and
  perform spectacular illusions at the theater. Tricks are assembled from component
  cards at each magician's personal workshop board, then staged in a tile-placement
  performance at the theater for fame points. With over 48 unique tricks across four
  categories and highly asymmetric magician powers, no two games play alike.
