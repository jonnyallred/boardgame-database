# Description
description: |
  A standalone deck-building game of space combat where players trade for
  powerful ships and bases from four factions, then attack to reduce their
  opponent's authority to zero. Features an all-new 80-card trade deck
  that can be played on its own or combined with the original Star Realms
  for up to four players. Fast-paced head-to-head dueling with faction
  synergy combos.
