# Description
description: |
  Space Base is a dice-rolling engine-building game for 2-5 players set in a sci-fi universe
  of space stations and starships. On your turn, you roll two dice and every player activates
  ships in their base corresponding to either die individually or their combined sum. Each ship
  card has three zones: a blue active zone (triggers on your own roll), a green passive zone
  (triggers on any roll), and a red deployed zone (triggers only on opponents' rolls). As you
  purchase and add ships, your engine grows more powerful, generating credits, income, and
  victory points each round. The first player to reach 40 points triggers the final round.
  With everyone engaged on every roll, Space Base eliminates downtime while rewarding clever
  ship purchases and strategic tableau-building decisions.
