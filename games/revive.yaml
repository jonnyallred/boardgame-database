# Description
description: |
  Rebuild civilization after an ice age catastrophe using asymmetric factions
  with unique abilities and deck-building mechanics. Players spread across a
  frozen map, gather resources, research technologies, and construct buildings
  to awaken humanity. Each faction has its own starting deck and special powers,
  creating radically different playstyles. Includes an optional campaign mode
  with persistent unlocks.
