# Description
description: |
  Set during Japan's Meiji era, players are merchants competing to gain
  fame through trading in the growing port city of Yokohama. Deploy
  assistants across a modular board to build connected paths, then move
  your president to activate powerful actions. Establish shops and trading
  houses, fulfill foreign trade contracts, acquire technology, and build
  your commercial network. A rich euro with interlocking systems and
  multiple paths to victory.
