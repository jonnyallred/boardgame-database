# Description
description: |
  A boardless abstract strategy game where two players command insect tiles,
  each with unique movement abilities, competing to completely surround the
  opponent's Queen Bee. With no board required, the hive itself forms
  dynamically as pieces are placed and moved on a hexagonal grid. Simple
  rules but deep strategic depth, often compared to chess. Winner of the
  Mensa Select award and International Gamers Award.
