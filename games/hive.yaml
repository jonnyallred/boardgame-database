# Description
description: |
  Hive is a two-player abstract strategy game in which players take turns placing and
  moving hexagonal tiles depicting insects to trap the opponent's Queen Bee. The game
  requires no board — pieces are played onto any flat surface, forming the "hive" as
  they are placed. Each player controls 11 tiles in contrasting colors, each depicting
  one of five insect types: the Queen Bee, Soldier Ant, Grasshopper, Spider, and Beetle.

  Every insect moves differently: the Queen Bee slides one space, the Beetle can crawl
  on top of the hive to block movement and capture spaces, the Grasshopper leaps over
  connected pieces to the first vacant space beyond, the Spider moves exactly three
  spaces along the hive's edge, and the Soldier Ant can move to any position around
  the hive. The critical constraint is the "One Hive Rule" — no piece may move if
  doing so would split the hive into two disconnected groups.

  Players must place their Queen Bee within their first four turns, after which it
  becomes the key target. Whoever completely surrounds the opponent's Queen Bee first
  wins. Hive won the Mensa Select award and is celebrated for its portability (no
  board required), fast setup, and deep tactical interplay despite its concise ruleset.
  Expansions add new insect pieces — the Mosquito, Ladybug, and Pillbug — each
  introducing additional movement abilities that further enrich the strategic options.
