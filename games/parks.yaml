# Description
description: |
  Hike through trails across four seasons, collecting memories and
  resources to visit National Parks. Each turn, move one of your two
  hikers forward on the trail to gather sun, water, mountains, forests,
  and wildlife tokens. Spend resources to claim Park cards worth varying
  points. Gorgeous artwork from the Fifty Nine Parks print series brings
  each National Park to life. Simple rules with satisfying tactical
  choices about timing and resource collection.
