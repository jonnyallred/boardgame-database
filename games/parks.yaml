# Description
description: |
  PARKS is a beautifully illustrated board game in which players take on the role of
  two hikers trekking through iconic US National Park trails across four seasons of
  the year. Each season, a new randomly-arranged trail is set up, and players move
  their hikers along it, collecting memories (resources) from the sites they visit —
  mountains, forests, wildlife, and unique park features.

  Players use their gathered memories to visit National Parks, take photos, purchase
  gear from the camp store, and acquire canteens to make their hikers more efficient.
  The trail has a key constraint: two hikers cannot share the same space, so players
  must carefully time their movement — moving quickly risks missing resources while
  moving slowly may cede the best park cards to opponents.

  The game features 48 National Park cards illustrated by 35 renowned artists from
  the Fifty-Nine Parks Print Series, plus 102 wooden resource tokens including
  wildlife tokens shaped like 12 iconic National Park animals. The nature theme and
  gorgeous artwork give PARKS a calm, contemplative feel despite the underlying
  resource-management strategy. It won Best Game from a Small Publisher and Best
  Family Game in Board Game Quest's 2019 awards.
