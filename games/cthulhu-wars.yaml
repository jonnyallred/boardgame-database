# Description
description: |
  Command one of four asymmetric factions of Great Old Ones vying for
  dominion over a post-apocalyptic Earth in this Lovecraftian strategy
  game. Each turn, players gather Power and spend it on actions such as
  recruiting cultists, summoning monsters, building gates, moving units,
  engaging in battle, and awakening their faction's Great Old One. Each
  faction plays completely differently with unique units, spellbooks, and
  victory requirements, creating deep strategic variety despite relatively
  streamlined core rules. Victory goes to the first player to reach 30
  Doom points while having unlocked all six of their faction's spellbooks.
