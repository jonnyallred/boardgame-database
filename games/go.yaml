# Description
description: |
  One of the oldest board games in existence, originating in China over 4,000
  years ago. Two players alternate placing black and white stones on a grid,
  aiming to surround more territory than the opponent. Stones or groups of
  stones that are completely surrounded are captured and removed. Despite
  having only a handful of rules, Go produces extraordinary strategic depth
  and complexity. The game is played on a 19x19 grid (with 9x9 and 13x13
  variants for shorter games). Considered one of the four essential arts of
  ancient Chinese culture.
