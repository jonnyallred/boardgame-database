# Description
description: |
  Sankoré: The Pride of Mansa Musa is a mid-to-heavy weight eurogame for 1-4
  players set in 14th-century Timbuktu, at the height of the Mali Empire's
  power. Tasked by the legendary Emperor Mansa Musa with spreading knowledge
  throughout West Africa, each player manages a prestigious school within the
  renowned Sankoré Madrasa — one of the great universities of the medieval world.

  Players compete to advance knowledge across four academic disciplines:
  theology, law, mathematics, and astronomy. Core actions revolve around
  enrolling and graduating pupils, teaching classes, expanding the school's
  curriculum, and filling the great library with books. Each discipline has its
  own track, and advancing along them unlocks more powerful capabilities and
  scoring opportunities, creating a rich engine-building experience.

  The game features point-to-point movement, resource management, and tech
  tracks that give each player a unique development arc. Components include a
  main board, four player boards, over 260 wooden pieces, and more than 190
  tokens, reflecting the game's depth and scope. A dedicated solo mode pits
  the player against an automated distinguished scholar with its own behavior
  system.

  Designed by Fabio Lopiano and Mandela Fernandez-Grandon with artwork by Ian
  O'Toole and published by Osprey Games in 2024, Sankoré is notable for its
  rich historical theme spotlighting Islamic West African scholarship — a
  rarely explored setting in modern board gaming — combined with a satisfying
  and densely interconnected euro engine.
