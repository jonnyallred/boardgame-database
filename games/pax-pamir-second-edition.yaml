# Description
description: |
  Play as power brokers in 19th-century Afghanistan during the Great Game
  between British, Russian, and Afghan factions. Court cards to build a
  tableau of tribes, armies, and infrastructure while pledging loyalty to
  whichever colonial power seems poised to dominate. Dominance checks score
  suddenly and brutally. Betray alliances, shift loyalties, and outmaneuver
  rivals to be on the winning side when the dust settles. Wehrlegig's
  production is sumptuous, with hand-illustrated cards and linen-finish quality.
