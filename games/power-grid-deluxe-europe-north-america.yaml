# Description
description: |
  The deluxe 10th anniversary edition of Power Grid, featuring a huge double-sided
  game board presenting all of Europe and all of North America (not just Germany
  and the USA from the original). Players compete to supply electricity to the most
  cities by bidding in fierce auctions for power plants, buying resources from a
  fluctuating commodity market, and expanding their networks across connected cities.
  This edition includes redesigned components, wooden tokens, and an innovative
  two-player mode called "Against the Trust" that adds a dummy opponent.
