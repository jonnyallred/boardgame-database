# Description
description: |
  A dice-drafting Euro set in deep space where players explore pulsars,
  develop technologies, and build gyrodyne systems. The clever dice
  selection mechanism forces trade-offs between powerful dice and turn
  order position. Multiple paths to victory through exploration, tech
  trees, and pulsar management create a satisfying strategic puzzle.
