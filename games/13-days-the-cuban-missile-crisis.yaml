# Description
description: |
  13 Days: The Cuban Missile Crisis is a tense two-player card-driven game
  condensing the geopolitical brinkmanship of the 1962 crisis into approximately
  45 minutes. One player takes the role of Kennedy, the other Khrushchev, and
  both players play through three rounds of escalating tension.

  Using a card-driven mechanism inspired by Twilight Struggle, players choose
  whether to use a card's command value (placing influence cubes in contested
  areas) or trigger its historical event. If you play a card belonging to your
  opponent's faction, they get the event while you use the command value. At
  the end of each round, areas are scored for Prestige — but if either side
  triggers DefCon 1, they lose immediately, perfectly capturing the mutual
  destruction dynamic. Often described as "Twilight Struggle in 45 minutes,"
  it is praised as one of the best two-player games for its strategic depth
  relative to its compact runtime.
