description: |
  Highly Suspect is a children's detective dexterity game by HABA where 2-4 detectives chase
  a crook hiding in a park. The game features a tiltable board: tilting the board in any
  direction causes all detective pieces and the crook piece to slide in that direction until
  they hit an obstacle. Players take turns tilting the board to maneuver their detective toward
  the crook's location while predicting how the crook will move. The simple tilting mechanic
  creates intuitive physical gameplay that children can immediately understand. The detective
  theme and the interactive board that reacts to tilting create a unique tactile experience
  that makes spatial thinking accessible for young players.
