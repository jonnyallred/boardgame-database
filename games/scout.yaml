# Description
description: |
  A clever ladder-climbing card game where you cannot rearrange the cards dealt
  to you — only rotate your entire hand to choose which end to play from. On your
  turn, either play a stronger set of adjacent same or consecutive-valued cards to
  beat the current table set, or "scout" by taking one card from the table set and
  inserting it anywhere in your hand while giving the previous player a point.
  The player who empties their hand first wins extra points. A compact filler with
  surprising strategic depth.
