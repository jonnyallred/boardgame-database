# Description
description: |
  Ladder-climbing card game where each card has two possible values and
  you cannot rearrange your hand. On your turn, play a set of cards that
  beats the current top set, or "scout" a card from the ends of the
  current set into your hand. Once per round you may scout and show in
  the same turn. Nominated for the 2022 Spiel des Jahres.
