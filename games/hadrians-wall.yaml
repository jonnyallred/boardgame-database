# Description
description: |
  Take on the role of a Roman General tasked with building a milecastle
  and bordering wall along Hadrian's Wall. Over six years (rounds), gain
  workers and resources, then simultaneously take actions to construct
  your fort and wall, man the defenses, and attract civilians. A deeply
  strategic flip-and-write game with interconnected tracks that trigger
  satisfying combo chains. Minimal player interaction makes it an
  excellent solo experience.
