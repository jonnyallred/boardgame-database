description: |
  Hedgehog Roll is a delightful cooperative dexterity game where players roll a fuzzy hedgehog
  ball across a field, collecting leaves, flowers, and pine cones that stick to its velcro-like
  surface. Moving the hedgehog forward one space for each item collected, players race to get
  their hedgehog home before the fox catches up. The game can be played cooperatively — working
  together to outrun the fox — or competitively, racing to be first to reach home. The physical
  act of rolling the fuzzy ball and watching items stick to it creates genuine delight, especially
  for young children. Simple enough for preschoolers yet charming enough for family play,
  Hedgehog Roll won multiple awards for its innovative use of tactile components and approachable
  cooperative mechanics.
