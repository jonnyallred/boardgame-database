# Description
description: |
  BattleLore is a two-player tactical miniatures wargame set at the dawn of
  the Hundred Years War, where medieval history intersects with high fantasy.
  Built on Richard Borg's Commands & Colors system — also used in Battle Cry and
  Memoir '44 — BattleLore features a hex grid divided into three sections (left,
  center, right flanks) where Command cards activate units in specific sectors.
  Battle dice with symbol-faces determine combat outcomes. The game's signature
  addition to the C&C system is the Lore Council mechanic, introducing magical
  units — goblins, dwarves, and elemental creatures — plus a council of advisors
  providing unique magical powers. Debuting at Essen 2006, BattleLore won
  widespread acclaim and spawned numerous expansion packs before Fantasy Flight
  Games released a redesigned second edition in 2013.
