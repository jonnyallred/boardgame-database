# Description
description: |
  Build a cavernous sanctuary and entice unique dragons to inhabit it.
  Excavate tunnels across three cave types, each offering different
  resources and abilities. Play dragon cards to populate your caves,
  triggering chain reactions of powers as you build your engine.
  A card-driven engine-building game inspired by Wingspan, reimagined
  with dragons and deeper strategic choices.
