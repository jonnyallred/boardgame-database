# Description
description: |
  As a chief astronaut in the year 2037, lead one of the first private
  enterprises to develop a self-sustaining colony on Mars. Split your
  actions between orbit and the planet surface, traveling via shuttle to
  access different capabilities. Construct mines, power generators, water
  extractors, greenhouses, oxygen factories, and shelters while managing
  an interconnected resource chain where colonists mine ore, ore creates
  energy, energy melts ice for water, water cultivates plants, and plants
  produce oxygen. One of Vital Lacerda's heaviest designs, featuring
  deeply interlocking systems and long-term strategic planning.
