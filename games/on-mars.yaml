# Description
description: |
  Lacerda's dense masterpiece about colonizing Mars. Players alternate between
  orbiting the planet (acquiring tech and supplies) and working on the surface
  (constructing buildings and infrastructure). Actions in orbit affect what's
  available on the surface and vice versa. Build a self-sustaining colony while
  racing to complete missions, develop technologies, and maximize personal
  objectives. Extraordinarily complex with punishing efficiency requirements—
  a rewarding puzzle for players who love deep interlocking systems.
