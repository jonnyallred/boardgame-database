# Description
description: |
  Ancestree is a tile-drafting game by Eric Lang in which two to six players
  build their family tree over three rounds. Each round begins with a hand of
  six ancestor tiles; players pick one and pass the rest, repeating until all
  tiles are claimed. Tiles show ancestors connected by leaves (family links) and
  hearts (marriages), and each tile placed must connect to the existing tree.
  Players score points for the longest connected generational chains and for
  coin icons, while marriages between players' trees can earn bonus points.
  After three rounds, the player with the most prestigious family lineage wins.
  The game's approachable design and whimsical art make it an excellent
  gateway experience for families.
