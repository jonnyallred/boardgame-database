# Description
description: |
  Furnace is an engine-building card game set in the 19th century industrial
  revolution, where players compete as capitalists building corporate empires
  by acquiring companies and processing resources into money.

  The game is played over four rounds, each with two phases. In the Auction
  phase, 6-8 company cards are laid out and players take turns placing
  numbered discs on them. No two discs of the same value or color may share
  a card. The player with the highest disc wins the card and adds it to their
  engine; players with lower discs instead receive compensation — resources
  or processing uses equal to their disc value. This creates an elegant
  tension: losing a bid deliberately can be just as rewarding as winning.

  In the Production phase, players activate their company cards once each to
  extract raw resources (coal, oil), process them into more valuable goods,
  and ultimately convert everything into money. Some cards can also be
  upgraded for more powerful future production.

  After four rounds, the player with the most money wins. Furnace is praised
  for its innovative auction compensation mechanic, which ensures players
  are never completely shut out of any round. The engine-building is
  streamlined and accessible, making it a strong gateway into the genre.
