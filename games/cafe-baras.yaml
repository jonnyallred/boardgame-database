# Description
description: |
  Run a cozy capybara café and compete to earn the most loyal regulars. Each
  turn you play one card from your hand, choosing whether to use its top portion
  as a café feature—food, drink, or décor—paying its coin cost to place it in
  your tableau, or to use the bottom portion as a customer order, cashing in
  matching café items to earn coins. Satisfying a customer's full appetite
  converts them into a Regular who scores bonus end-game points. Draw a
  replacement card from the open marketplace after each action, keeping hand
  size constant. The game ends when someone claims their third Regular and the
  last Special Guest card. Score coins, café card values, Regulars, and Special
  Guests—most points wins. Delightfully illustrated multi-use cards keep every
  decision tight despite the gentle rules, making Café Baras a welcoming choice
  for families and a strong filler between heavier games.
