# Description
description: |
  Compete to become the next great spirit of the forest in this deeply
  strategic Euro game steeped in Japanese mythology. Manage forest spirits
  called Bitoku, guide pilgrims along sacred paths, and gather resources
  from the woodland. Multiple interlocking systems of dice placement, card
  play, and worker management create a rich strategic experience.
