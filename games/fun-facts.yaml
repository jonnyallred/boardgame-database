# Description
description: |
  Fun Facts is a party game published by Repos Production in 2022 in which players write
  personal answers to numerical questions on transparent paddles and then collaboratively
  order them from lowest to highest — without revealing their actual numbers. Each round,
  a question is read aloud, such as "How many times a year do you eat pizza?" or "How
  tall is your tallest relative in centimeters?" Each player secretly writes their answer
  on a numbered paddle. Players then discuss and debate the correct order, placing their
  paddles in sequence. Answers are revealed simultaneously, and the group scores points
  for each correctly placed answer. Fun Facts generates laughter, surprising revelations,
  and intimate moments of learning new things about friends and family, making it an
  ideal icebreaker or party game for mixed groups.
