# Description
description: |
  Speakeasy transports players to 1920s Manhattan during Prohibition, where Lucky Luciano
  and other mobsters control the city's underground. Players take on the roles of rival
  mobsters, managing and operating their own speakeasy empire across four rounds representing
  the 13 years of Prohibition.

  Players manage a hand of operation cards throughout the game, with player boards tracking
  VIP, party, still, fleet, and strength levels. The game features area majority and
  influence mechanics combined with pick-up and deliver elements. As each round progresses,
  new mobsters enter the city while police presence grows, increasing pressure on all players.

  Designed by Vital Lacerda and illustrated by Ian O'Toole, Speakeasy is a heavy euro
  experience with deep strategic planning and rich historical theming. The goal is to
  accumulate the most money and become the most successful mobster in Manhattan.
