# Description
description: |
  Players represent noble houses on the royal council of the Kingdom of Ankist,
  voting on dilemmas that shape the kingdom's fate. Each round draws a new crisis
  from the legacy deck, and through negotiation and secret agendas, players vote
  to determine outcomes. Your house seeks power and wealth, but pushing too hard
  may plunge the realm into war, famine, or chaos. Choices permanently alter the
  evolving story across multiple sessions, unlocking branching narratives through
  sealed envelopes and stickers in this legacy experience.
