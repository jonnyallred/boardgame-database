description: |
  Caverna: Cave vs Cave is a streamlined two-player variant of Uwe Rosenberg's popular Caverna:
  The Cave Farmers. Players start with two dwarves and a small mountain excavation, competing
  to build the most prosperous cave community in eight rounds. Dwarves double in number over
  the course of the game, new cave spaces are excavated, and buildings and rooms are constructed.
  Resources are gathered and converted into improvements that earn victory points at game end.
  The smaller scope compared to the original Caverna makes it more approachable for two-player
  sessions, playing in 20-40 minutes while retaining the satisfying cave-building progression
  that fans love. An excellent gateway into Rosenberg's style of worker placement games.
