# Description
description: |
  Top Secret Spies (German: Heimlich & Co.) is a spy-themed German-style board game
  designed by Wolfgang Kramer and published by Ravensburger in 1984. Also known as
  Under Cover or Detective & Co, the game won the prestigious Spiel des Jahres award
  in 1986.

  Seven differently colored spy pawns move around an oval track where spaces award points.
  Each player secretly controls one color, keeping their identity hidden throughout the
  game. On each turn, the active player rolls a die and then moves any combination of
  spies forward that total number of spaces — strategically advancing their own spy while
  obscuring their identity by moving others too.

  Players score points based on where spies land, and at the end of the game, players
  reveal their secret identities and gain bonus points for correctly guessing other
  players' colors. Historically significant, Top Secret Spies is credited as one of the
  first games to feature a score track encircling the board, and an early game to use
  thin wooden human-shaped gaming pieces now commonly called meeples.
