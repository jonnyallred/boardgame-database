# Description
description: |
  DVONN is a two-player abstract strategy game and the fourth title in the acclaimed GIPF Project series,
  designed by Kris Burm and published in 2001. It is played on an elongated hexagonal board with 49 spaces.

  The game unfolds in two phases. In the placement phase, players alternate placing the three neutral
  red DVONN pieces and then their own 23 white or 23 black pieces onto the board. In the movement
  phase, stacks of pieces are moved: a stack of height n must move exactly n spaces in a straight line
  and must land on another piece or stack. The top piece of a stack determines who controls it.

  The defining mechanic is connectivity: after every move, any piece or stack that is not connected
  (via a chain of adjacent stacks) to at least one DVONN piece is immediately removed from the board.
  This means players must constantly balance offensive stack-building against the risk of cutting off
  their own pieces from the vital DVONN pieces. The game ends when no more legal moves can be made,
  and the player controlling the most pieces (by total stack height) wins.

  DVONN won the 2002 International Gamers Award and the Games magazine Game of the Year Award in 2003,
  and was selected as a Mensa Select game. It is widely regarded as one of the finest pure abstract
  strategy games ever designed, praised for its elegant rules that produce extraordinarily deep and
  tense play.
