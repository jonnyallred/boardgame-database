# Description
description: |
  Aftermath is the third entry in Plaid Hat Games' Adventure Book Game series,
  following Stuffed Fables and Comanauts. Players control small woodland critters
  — mice, guinea pigs, and hamsters — navigating a post-apocalyptic Earth where
  humanity has vanished and nature has reclaimed civilization. Each mission is
  played on spiral-bound book pages that double as the game map, with each spread
  providing unique rules, story text, and challenges. The card-based action system
  offers more strategic choice and less randomness than the dice-driven earlier
  Adventure Book titles. Investigators manage personal goals alongside colony
  survival needs, scavenging for food and deciphering the strange artifacts left
  behind by the vanished humans. The persistent campaign develops the colony
  between sessions, creating a rich narrative of small-scale survival and discovery.
