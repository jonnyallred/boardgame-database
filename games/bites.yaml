# Description
description: |
  Bites (originally published as Big Points in 2008 by Schmidt Spiele, where it received a Spiel des Jahres nomination) is a light strategy game about ants collecting food along a trail. Players move colored ants to matching food tokens on a trail, then collect the food token directly in front of or behind the ant — creating a satisfying push-and-pull about when to score and when to leave food for later.

  Each game is customized with variable "rules cards" that introduce new twists to scoring and movement, keeping every play fresh. The ant-themed trail gradually shrinks as food is claimed, creating an increasingly constrained and tense endgame. Bites is a superb gateway game: easy to teach in minutes, plays in under 30 minutes, and offers enough tactical depth to keep experienced gamers engaged. The 2020 republication by Allplay brought the game to a wider audience with updated production values.
