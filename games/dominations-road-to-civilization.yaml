# Description
description: |
  Dominations: Road to Civilization is a civilization-building game played over three ages,
  each consisting of five rounds. Players take on the role of a primitive tribe and develop
  it into a nation whose influence echoes through the ages.

  The core mechanism revolves around placing triangular dominoes (camp tiles), where each
  corner bears one of six knowledge symbols: Government, Religion, Art, Trade, Science, and
  Craftsmanship. Placing tiles generates knowledge in those domains, and players must
  carefully consider tile placement to maximize their knowledge income while expanding their
  territory.

  Knowledge is spent to construct Cities and Monuments on the board, and to acquire Mastery
  Cards — a tech tree of permanent effects that define the civilization's unique development
  path. Each age unlocks more powerful Mastery Cards, creating a sense of escalating
  progression throughout the game.

  The game rewards long-term planning and optimization across multiple interconnected
  systems. Players must balance tile placement for knowledge generation, investment in the
  Mastery Card tree, and competition for monuments and cities. The puzzle of balancing all
  components simultaneously is considered the game's greatest strength by reviewers.
