# Description
description: |
  The massive sequel to Gloomhaven, set in a frozen northern outpost beset
  by harsh winters and hostile forces. Players explore 100+ scenarios while
  managing a developing town between adventures. New systems include seasonal
  weather, loot crafting, building upgrades, and summer/winter scenario
  cycles. Character classes are redesigned with fresh mechanics, and the
  overland map adds exploration outside dungeons. Larger, deeper, and more
  ambitious than Gloomhaven in every dimension.
