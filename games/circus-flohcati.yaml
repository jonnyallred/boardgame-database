description: |
  Circus Flohcati is a light press-your-luck and set-collection card game by Reiner Knizia themed
  around a quirky flea circus. Ten types of acts — each valued 0 to 7 — form the deck. On your
  turn, flip face-down cards one at a time to add to a face-up display, then take one for your hand.
  But if you reveal a card matching any already-displayed color, your turn immediately ends with
  nothing. Collecting sets of 10 different act types earns a bonus; the highest-value set claims
  a valuable gala card. Occasional action cards trigger theft or other disruptions. The push-your-luck
  mechanism is simple enough for children yet punishing enough to create real tension, making this
  a beloved filler that plays quickly and rewards knowing when to stop.
