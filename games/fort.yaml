# Description
description: |
  Fort is a deck-building card game for 2-4 players set in the world of childhood summers,
  where players compete to grow their circle of friends, collect pizza and toys, and build
  the coolest fort on the block.

  The game's central twist on the deckbuilding formula is a "follow the leader" mechanic:
  when a player takes an action, other players may follow along by discarding a matching
  card from their hand. Cards are organized by suit (crowns, skateboards, glue, books,
  and shovels), and playing multiple cards of the same suit amplifies the action's power.
  Each card has a public action (which others can follow) and a private action (for the
  active player only).

  Crucially, cards left unplayed in a hand at the end of a turn are vulnerable — opponents
  can recruit those neglected kids into their own decks. This creates constant pressure to
  use your cards wisely and keep your friends close. Players score victory points by
  constructing their fort and accumulating resources, and the game ends when a player
  completes their fort or the kid deck is exhausted.

  Fort was rethemed from the 2018 game SPQF (also by Rodiek), which featured forest animals
  in an Ancient Rome setting. It was nominated at the 2021 SXSW Gaming Awards for Tabletop
  Game of the Year. Kyle Ferrin's distinctive whimsical art gives the game a charming,
  nostalgic feel consistent with other Leder Games titles.
