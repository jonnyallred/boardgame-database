# Description
description: |
  Set sail in the 17th-century Caribbean, vying for influence among three colonial
  powers across four rounds of play. Players move their ships around a rondel-style
  track of island ports, collecting goods, completing quests, and battling for area
  control. A rich hand-management system lets you play cards for immediate effects or
  install them as ongoing engines in your tableau. An optional story mode adds a
  narrative campaign layer that unfolds over multiple plays without permanently altering
  components, giving Maracaibo a unique legacy-like experience.
