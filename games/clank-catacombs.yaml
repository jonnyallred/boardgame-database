# Description
description: |
  A standalone entry in the Clank! series where players explore a procedurally
  generated dungeon built from modular room tiles. Sneak deeper into the catacombs
  to steal artifacts from a dragon, but every noisy action adds clank cubes to the
  dragon's bag, risking damage. The dungeon layout is different every game thanks
  to double-sided room tiles placed as players explore, creating unique paths,
  treasures, and challenges. Combines deck building with push-your-luck dungeon
  delving in a tense race to escape alive.
