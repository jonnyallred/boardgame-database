# Description
description: |
  A standalone re-implementation of Concordia bundled with the Venus expansion
  content. Includes two new maps (Ionium and Hellas), new Venus personality
  cards enabling fresh strategies, support for a sixth player, and team play
  rules for 4 or 6 players in 2-3 teams. Fully compatible with all existing
  Concordia expansions. The core gameplay remains the same elegant card-driven
  economic system set in the Roman Mediterranean.
