# Description
description: |
  A standalone expansion to Wingspan featuring birds of Asia, playable alone
  or combined with other Wingspan editions. Introduces the Duet mode, a head-to-head
  variant for exactly two players using a shared map of terrain tiles. Also adds new
  flock mechanics for large groups and swift-start cards to reduce setup time. The
  170 unique Asian bird cards bring new engine combinations to the beloved Wingspan
  system.
