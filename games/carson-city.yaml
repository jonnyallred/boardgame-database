description: |
  Carson City is a worker placement game with a wild west theme where players compete to build
  and control the most lucrative properties in a rapidly expanding frontier town. Players
  simultaneously choose from seven available characters that provide unique advantages, then
  place cowboys on action spots to claim land, construct buildings, earn money, or score points.
  Unlike most worker placement games, if an opponent's cowboy already occupies a desired space,
  you can challenge them to a duel resolved by dice. This confrontational element makes territory
  selection tense and strategic — knowing which spots are worth fighting for adds a layer
  of psychological play. The SimCity-like emergence of the town board creates visual storytelling
  as buildings develop organically around available space.
