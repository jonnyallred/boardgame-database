description: |
  Hell Dorado is a 28mm skirmish miniatures wargame set in an alternate 16th century history
  where the 30 Years War was interrupted by the discovery of a new frontier — not the Americas,
  but Hell itself. Competing factions including Western Crusaders, Saracens, demonic forces, and
  Immortals wage brutal skirmish battles in the hellish underworld. Originally published in French
  by Asmodee in 2006, an English second edition was released in 2011 by Cipher Studios. Each
  faction has unique models, rules, and thematic abilities, creating deeply asymmetric gameplay.
  The game's dark, detailed miniatures and evocative alternate-history setting — combining
  historical warfare with supernatural horror — attracted a dedicated following among miniature
  gaming enthusiasts.
