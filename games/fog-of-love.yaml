# Description
description: |
  Fog of Love is a narrative two-player game about falling in love published by Hush Hush
  Projects in 2017. Each player creates a character and together they experience a romantic
  comedy that evolves through scenario chapters. On each turn, players play scene cards from
  their hands that describe situations, and characters respond in ways that reflect their
  personalities, desires, and goals — some of which are kept secret. Characters have traits
  that are shaped by decisions throughout the story, and each player has hidden objectives
  (their "destiny") that define what kind of relationship outcome they're rooting for. The
  game can end with a happily-ever-after, a bittersweet parting, or anything in between.
  Fog of Love is widely celebrated for its innovative approach to storytelling, its emotional
  resonance, and its ability to generate meaningful shared experiences that feel genuinely
  personal and surprising.
