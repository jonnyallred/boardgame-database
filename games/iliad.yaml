# Description
description: |
  Iliad is a competitive card game for 2 to 6 players inspired by Homer's battle epic of
  the Trojan War. Players take on the roles of heroes vying to besiege Troy and claim glory,
  racing to be the first to accumulate 12 victory points (15 in a two-player game).

  The game is divided into rounds called "sieges." Each round, an Oracle card is revealed
  to set the conditions of that siege, and Victory cards are turned face-up to show what
  glory is at stake. Players then take turns playing Army cards from their hands, competing
  to achieve the highest total score and claim the Victory cards on offer.

  The deck consists of 75 Army cards representing different troop types — Archers, Hoplites,
  Chariots, Elephants, Ballistae, Catapults, Harrows, and Trojan Horses — each with
  strengths and weaknesses in a rock-paper-scissors style combat system. Attacks also cost
  the attacking unit, so timing and card management are crucial.

  In games with three or more players, Hero cards (featuring figures like Patroclus and
  Achilles) are available: a player who passes their turn on a siege may claim the
  highest-value hero available, adding that hero's strength to their army — a risk-reward
  decision between competing for the current siege versus banking a powerful hero for later.

  Designed by Dominique Ehrhard and published by Asmodée in 2006, Iliad offers elegant,
  fast-playing card game action with strong production values and a light mythological theme.
