# Description
description: |
  Evergreen is a card drafting and biome-building game published by Horrible Guild in 2022.
  Players compete to create the most fertile planet by planting seeds, growing trees and
  bushes, and building mountains and rivers. Cards are drafted from a shared market, and
  each card shows the type of terrain to be placed and a biome affiliation. At the end of
  each of four seasons, a sun card is revealed that indicates which biome scores — but only
  the tallest trees and largest connected terrain groups in that biome count. Players who
  have placed the most valuable components in the scoring biome gain victory points. With
  its beautiful nature artwork, simple drafting rules, and interesting end-game scoring
  that rewards forward planning, Evergreen is an accessible and visually appealing game
  suitable for families and casual gamers.
