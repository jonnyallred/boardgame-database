# Description
description: |
  Clank! A Deck-Building Adventure is a competitive deck-builder in which players take on the roles of thieves sneaking into an angry dragon's underground lair to steal precious artifacts. Each turn players play all cards from their hand, generating Skill to acquire new cards, Boots to move through the dungeon, and Swords to fight monsters lurking in the depths. Making noise produces Clank! cubes that go into a bag, and whenever a Dragon Attack card is drawn the dragon draws from that bag — the more cubes you have in there, the higher the chance of taking damage. Players race to snatch the most valuable artifact they can find and escape to the surface before the dragon incapacitates them, with deeper artifacts worth more points but requiring greater peril to retrieve. The game cleverly blends the efficiency of deck-building with push-your-luck tension and spatial movement across a double-sided dungeon board.
