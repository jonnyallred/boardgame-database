# Description
description: |
  Sneak into a dragon's lair to steal precious artifacts, but be quiet about it.
  Build your deck to gain skills, recruit allies, and acquire tools for your
  dungeon delve. Every loud action adds clank cubes to the dragon bag, and when
  the dragon attacks, noisy adventurers suffer the most. Push deeper for greater
  treasures, but make sure you escape before the dragon overwhelms you. The
  original deck-building dungeon adventure that launched the Clank! series.
