# Description
description: |
  Turing Machine is a unique deduction game published by Le Scorpion Masqué in 2022,
  designed by Fabien Gridel and Yoann Levet. Players use a physical analog computer made
  of perforated punch cards to discover a secret three-digit code, evoking the spirit of
  early computing and wartime cryptography.

  Each round, players create a proposal — a three-digit code — using punch cards and test
  it against up to three Verifier cards drawn from the box. The Verifier cards reveal
  whether the proposed code meets hidden criteria without revealing the criteria themselves.
  By systematically narrowing possibilities through logical deduction, players race to be
  the first to identify the exact secret code.

  The game can be played solo, cooperatively, or competitively with up to four players.
  The punch card mechanism is entirely novel — no apps or electronics required — and
  creates an elegant analog computing experience. With hundreds of available puzzles
  across varying difficulty levels, Turing Machine offers exceptional replay value in a
  compact, quick-playing format.
