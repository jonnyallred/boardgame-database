# Description
description: |
  Arkadia challenges two to four players as builders competing to erect houses
  in a medieval city surrounding a central castle. Players hold cards in hand
  and play them to claim building lots and place workers, constructing houses
  that bear the seal of one of four noble families. The castle under construction
  is central to scoring: as players complete houses adjacent to it, the castle
  grows outward, adding new seal icons that change the relative values of each
  family's seal. Seals can be converted into victory points at any time, but their
  worth fluctuates constantly as the castle expands. When the second layer of the
  castle is completed, the final round begins. Nominated for the 2007 Spiel des
  Jahres, Arkadia rewards players who can read the evolving seal values and time
  their conversions optimally.
