description: |
  Dinosaurus is a fast, luck-free abstract strategy game by Christwart Conrad set in the
  primordial Pangea. A 4x4 grid of terrain cards is laid out, and players take turns placing
  their dinosaur pieces — herbivores, carnivores, and flying dinosaurs of different sizes —
  at the edges of the square. Different dinosaur types have different placement rules and
  competing behaviors that create dynamic territorial control. Players compete to reign over
  Pangea by positioning their dinosaur species advantageously on the terrain grid. The game's
  abstract nature and simple placement rules make it accessible as a family game while offering
  enough strategic depth for repeated play. Published by German publisher HUCH!, known for
  family and party games.
