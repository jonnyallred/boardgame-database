# Description
description: |
  Legacy of Yu is a fully-resettable solo campaign game set in ancient China during
  the reign of Emperor Yao. Players step into the role of Yu the Great, the legendary
  hero of the Xia Dynasty tasked with building canals to redirect the catastrophic
  floods of the Yellow River while simultaneously defending a growing village against
  encroaching barbarian tribes.

  The campaign ends when you accumulate either seven wins or seven losses across
  individual game sessions. Each session adds new story elements and gameplay
  components, with a self-balancing difficulty system that makes the game harder
  after victories and slightly easier after defeats. Unlike traditional legacy games,
  all components are fully resettable — nothing is destroyed — allowing the entire
  campaign to be replayed, though branching narrative choices and randomized elements
  ensure subsequent playthroughs feel distinct.

  Core gameplay revolves around worker placement on a modular board, hand management
  of townsfolk cards for resource generation, and making difficult decisions under
  mounting pressure from both floods and barbarian raids. The game was designed
  exclusively for solo play and was originally funded via Kickstarter before receiving
  wide retail distribution through Renegade Game Studios.
