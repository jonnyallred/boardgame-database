# Description
description: |
  An open-world sandbox adventure set in the American Wild West where
  players take on the roles of historical figures like Wyatt Earp or
  Billy the Kid. Earn legendary status through many paths: gamble at the
  saloon, drive cattle, prospect for gold, rob the bank, fight bandits,
  or enforce the law. Each turn consists of drawing poker cards and
  taking three actions, with multiple viable strategies.
