# Description
description: |
  Egyptian-themed area control game that rewards aggression over turtling.
  Spend action points to pray for resources, move armies, recruit troops,
  or buy powerful upgrade tiles across red (combat), blue (defense/economy),
  and white (divine/movement) tech trees. Battles use a simultaneous card
  selection system with no dice - bluffing and reading your opponent is key.
  Teleportation via pyramids keeps the map fluid and ensures no one is safe.
  Victory points come from winning battles, holding temples, controlling
  pyramids, and purchasing high-level power tiles.
