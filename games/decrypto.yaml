# Description
description: |
  Two teams compete to crack each other's secret codes while protecting their own.
  Each team has a screen with four keywords numbered 1–4, visible only to their
  own members. The active encryptor draws a code card showing three numbers and must
  give clues precise enough for teammates to guess correctly — but vague enough that
  rivals can't intercept them. Teams win by intercepting two of the opposing team's
  transmissions before accumulating two miscommunication tokens. The game rewards
  clever, consistent clue-giving and attentive listening across rounds.
