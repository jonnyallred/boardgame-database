# Description
description: |
  Two teams race to decode secret three-digit codes while trying to
  intercept the opposing team's codes. Each round, one player gives
  creative word clues that relate to their team's hidden keyword cards.
  Teammates must correctly guess the code, while opponents track clues
  across rounds to deduce the hidden words. Earn white tokens by
  intercepting enemy codes; collect two to win. But receive two black
  tokens from miscommunication and you lose. Winner of multiple awards
  including the 2018 As d'Or.
