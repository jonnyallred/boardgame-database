description: |
  Heaven & Ale is a challenging resource management game set in a medieval monastery where
  players take on the role of a monk tasked with producing the finest beer. Players use a
  rondel to place monks and prioresses on garden patches, harvesting resources like hops,
  malt, and water. The game's signature mechanic is its scoring system: resources on the
  inside of your cloister score well, but placing them inside means giving the field to an
  opponent. Advancing resource markers increases their value, but the player who advances
  the least valuable marker at game end scores zero for that resource — creating painful
  bottleneck decisions. Balancing what to keep, what to surrender, and how far to advance
  each resource track makes every decision agonizing and deeply satisfying for strategic thinkers.
