# Description
description: |
  Diced Veggies is a casual dice-drafting game about collecting vegetable ingredients
  and cooking them into tasty recipes. Players take turns wielding the cleaver, slicing
  groups of ingredient dice away from a shared chopping block and assigning them to the
  recipes they are working on. The key constraint: the numbers on the dice you grab must
  have a combined total of 10 or lower, forcing clever selection decisions each turn.

  Dice come in five colors representing different vegetables: Carrot (yellow), Mushroom
  (tan), Onion (pink), Pepper (green), and Tomato (red). Each recipe card requires
  specific combinations of vegetables, and the first player to complete the target number
  of recipes triggers the end of the game. Hype cards and Chef tokens add additional
  depth for experienced players, while a simplified beginner variant makes the game
  approachable for younger children by removing those elements and capping dice grabs at
  three dice instead of using the sum-of-10 rule.

  Designed by Josh Cappel alongside his children Jory and Rowan, Diced Veggies won the
  2024 Origins Award for Best Children's & Family Board Game. The game premiered at Gen
  Con 2023 and was published by Kids Table Board Gaming (KTBG), a Canadian publisher
  focused on games that play well across the full family age range.
