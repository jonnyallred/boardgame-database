# Description
description: |
  Mysterium is a cooperative deduction game set in a haunted mansion where one player
  takes the role of a ghost who was murdered under mysterious circumstances. Unable to
  speak, the ghost communicates with the other players — a group of psychic mediums —
  solely through illustrated dream vision cards depicting surreal imagery of people,
  places, and objects.

  Each medium must identify the correct suspect, location, and murder weapon associated
  with their character by interpreting the dream cards the ghost sends them each round.
  The ghost knows which cards to send but cannot speak or gesture, only deal cards from
  their hand. Mediums discuss their interpretations openly and vote on which possibility
  the ghost is pointing to.

  The game unfolds over seven rounds (representing hours of a seance). In the final
  phase, all mediums who correctly identified their clues receive a final vision pointing
  to the true culprit, and the group votes together on who committed the crime.

  Mysterium draws frequent comparisons to Dixit (for its dream-like artwork and
  communication through imagery) and Clue (for its murder mystery deduction structure),
  blending the two into a unique cooperative experience. The game was originally
  designed in Ukraine and published by Igames before Libellud acquired the rights and
  produced the widely distributed 2015 edition with new artwork.
