# Description
description: |
  An asymmetric fantasy wargame set in the world of Kalar, where six kingdoms clash
  across four hand-painted hex maps in a 12-year war. Players command one of six
  factions — Goblins, Orcs, Army of the Night, Dwarfs, Fjordland, and Eastern Empire
  — each with unique units, heroes, and win conditions. Deploy troops by spending
  income, march across hex terrain, and resolve battles by rolling pools of dice
  (hits on 5+, with critical explosion mechanics for dramatic moments).

  Twenty-nine scenarios scale the conflict from quick two-kingdom skirmishes on a
  single map to the full campaign chronicle spanning all four maps. A Basic rulebook
  covers core movement, battle, and economic actions; the Advanced rules layer in
  heroes, monsters, spell cards, faction blessing decks, and dungeon-exploration
  side adventures. Christopher Moeller designed and hand-drew all maps, counters,
  and artwork, giving the game a distinctive old-school fantasy illustration style
  reminiscent of classic D&D sourcebooks. Best at 2-4 players; downtime grows
  significantly at five or six.
