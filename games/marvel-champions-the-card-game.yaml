# Description
description: |
  Marvel Champions: The Card Game is a cooperative Living Card Game (LCG) in which
  one to four players each control a Marvel superhero and work together to stop a
  villain from completing a nefarious scheme. Each hero is represented by a 40-50
  card pre-built deck that can be customized with one of five aspect decks (Justice,
  Aggression, Protection, Leadership, or Basic cards), allowing players to tailor
  their hero to a preferred play style.

  On each player's turn they may flip between their hero and alter-ego identity —
  the alter-ego side allows recovery and special abilities tied to civilian life,
  while the hero side enables attacks and thwarting the villain's scheme. Players
  spend resources from their hand to play events, allies, supports, and upgrades,
  then discard remaining cards to pay for others, creating constant hand-management
  tension.

  The villain deck drives an automated threat system: if the scheme advances too far
  before the villain is defeated, the players lose. Modular encounter sets let players
  swap in different side schemes, hazards, and minion configurations to vary every
  session. The core set includes five heroes (Iron Man, Spider-Man, Captain Marvel,
  She-Hulk, Black Panther) and three villains (Rhino, Klaw, Ultron), with hundreds
  of expansions adding heroes, villains, and campaigns released under the LCG model
  (no randomized packs — every card is known in advance).

  Marvel Champions won Board Game Quest's 2019 Cooperative Game of the Year and
  has become one of the most expansive LCG ecosystems in the hobby, praised for
  its accessibility to new players and deep deckbuilding for veterans.
