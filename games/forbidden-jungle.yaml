description: |
  Forbidden Jungle is the fourth game in Matt Leacock's Forbidden series (after Forbidden Island,
  Forbidden Desert, and Forbidden Sky). Players have crash-landed on a jungle-covered spaceport
  on a remote moon and must power up a portal to escape. The game introduces active antagonists
  for the first time in the series: spiders in three life stages — eggs, hatchlings, and adults —
  that actively hunt players, sting them, and spin webs to block tile exits. Tiles sink into
  sinkholes like Forbidden Island, can be shifted like Forbidden Desert, and the escape mechanic
  echoes Forbidden Sky's power-up system. Each adventurer has unique special powers that encourage
  teamwork. The combination of familiar Forbidden mechanics with new spider threat creates a
  fresh and more dangerous cooperative experience.
