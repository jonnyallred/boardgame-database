# Description
description: |
  Res Arcana is a tight engine-building card game in which 2-4 alchemical mages compete to
  accumulate victory points through mastery of magical essences and arcane artifacts. Each
  player drafts an 8-card micro-deck from a shared pool of 40 unique artifact cards, selects
  a mage with a special power, and chooses a magic item at the start of each game — ensuring
  high variability across sessions.

  Gameplay centers on five mystical essences — Gold, Life, Calm, Death, and Elan — which fuel
  artifact abilities. On their turn, players may place an artifact from their hand, claim a
  Monument or Place of Power, use a power on a played component, discard a card for essence,
  or pass (trading in their magic item and drawing a card). The first player to reach 10 or
  more victory points triggers a final scoring check; the player with the most points wins.

  A typical game runs 4-6 rounds and rewards tight resource management and combo-building with
  a compact set of cards. The game was recommended by the Spiel des Jahres jury in 2019.
  Expansions include Lux et Tenebrae (adds Demons and Scrolls, fifth-player support) and
  Perlae Imperii (adds Pearl essence and raises the victory threshold to 13 points).
