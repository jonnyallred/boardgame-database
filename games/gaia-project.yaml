# Description
description: |
  Gaia Project is a deep strategic successor to Terra Mystica, transporting its
  asymmetric faction-building gameplay into a science-fiction galaxy setting. Fourteen
  distinct alien factions vie for control of a modular hex-grid galaxy, each bound to
  a specific planet type and requiring terraforming to colonize new worlds.

  Players expand their civilization by building mines, trading posts, research labs,
  academies, and planetary institutes across the galaxy. A key innovation over Terra
  Mystica is the multi-track research board, where players advance along six technology
  tracks — Terraforming, Navigation, Artificial Intelligence, Gaiaforming, Economy, and
  Science — unlocking powerful upgrades and bonuses. Gaiaforming allows certain factions
  to convert barren Transdimensional planets into habitable Gaia worlds.

  Power management through three power bowls remains central to the game, alongside a
  rich economy of ore, credits, and knowledge. Players score points via round bonuses,
  end-game scoring tiles, research track milestones, federation tokens, and the final
  tally of structures, research levels, and alliances. With highly asymmetric faction
  abilities, a modular board with variable setup, and interlocking systems, Gaia Project
  rewards deep strategic planning and repeated plays. It is widely considered one of
  the most strategically complex Eurogames ever published.
