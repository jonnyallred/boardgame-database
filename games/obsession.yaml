# Description
description: |
  Take the helm of a respected but troubled family estate in mid-19th
  century Victorian England. Over 16 to 20 turns, build a deck of
  Victorian gentry, renovate your estate by acquiring building tiles
  from a centralized builders' market, and manage an extensive service
  staff of butlers, housekeepers, underbutlers, maids, valets, and
  footmen through a novel worker placement mechanic. Host prestigious
  social activities such as Fox Hunts, Music Recitals, Billiards,
  Political Debates, and Grand Balls to increase your wealth,
  reputation, and connections. Compete for the courtship of the most
  eligible young gentleman and lady in the county to win the game.
