# Description
description: |
  Manage a Victorian English country estate, recruit staff, renovate buildings,
  and host social events to climb the ranks of polite society. Each turn, select
  an activity (croquet, cards, a dinner party), assign servants from your
  personal deck, and invite gentry guests who reward reputation and resources.
  Build your estate's amenities to unlock more prestigious events and attract
  higher-status visitors. A charming Downton Abbey feel with tight deck-building
  and worker placement decisions woven together elegantly.
