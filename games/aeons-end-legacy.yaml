# Description
description: |
  The first legacy cooperative deck-building game, set in a post-apocalyptic
  world where Breach Mages defend the last city of Gravehold against The
  Nameless. Players build their decks over a multi-session campaign, making
  permanent decisions that shape characters, abilities, and the story.
  Features the series' signature mechanic of never shuffling your discard
  pile, adding strategic control over card order.
