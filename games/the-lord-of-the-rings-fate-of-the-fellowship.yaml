  to protect Frodo, battle enemies across Middle-earth, and evade the Nazgul.
  Gather heroes, defend havens from advancing shadow troops, and complete
  objectives that change each playthrough. Features 24 objectives, 14 events,
  and 13 playable characters. Players win when Frodo destroys the One Ring
  at Mount Doom.
