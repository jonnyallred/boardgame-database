# Description
description: |
  Railroad Tiles is a tile placement game and spiritual successor to the Railroad Ink
  roll-and-write series, published by Horrible Guild in 2025. Designed by Hjalmar Hach
  and Lorenzo Silva, it converts the pen-and-paper formula into a tactile drafting and
  tile-laying experience for 1-4 players.

  The game is played over eight rounds. At the start of each round, players draft tiles
  from a communal pool, selecting from route tiles that depict roads, railways, and
  connections. Once drafted, each player places their chosen tiles in front of them,
  building a personal grid of interlocking routes and trying to form the most efficient
  network possible.

  Scoring rewards connections: the more pieces of the same type a new tile connects to,
  the more points it generates. Players can also populate their landscapes by placing
  cars, trains, or travelers on tiles that have free space, adding additional scoring
  opportunities. End-game bonuses reward arranging tiles into a solid rectangle without
  gaps and building clusters of three or more adjacent city tiles.

  Railroad Tiles adds a layer of interactivity over Railroad Ink through the shared
  drafting pool, meaning players compete for the same tiles rather than all working
  from an identical draw. This makes it a slightly more competitive and interactive
  experience while retaining the accessible, breezy feel of the original series.
