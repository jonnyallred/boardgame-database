# Description
description: |
  Isle of Skye: From Chieftain to King is a tile-laying game for 2-5 players where
  each player is the chieftain of a Scottish clan, building their own kingdom on the
  legendary Isle of Skye. Players draw landscape tiles each round and must decide
  which to keep and at what price to sell to opponents.

  The game's central mechanic is its pricing and auction system: each round, players
  draw three tiles and place them behind their player screen. One tile is secretly
  marked for discard, and the other two receive prices set by the owning player. The
  catch — if another player doesn't buy a priced tile, the owner must pay that price
  themselves. This creates tense bluffing decisions: price a tile high and risk being
  stuck paying for it, or price it low and invite rivals to snap it up cheaply.

  A key driver of replayability is the scoring tile system. The game includes 16
  different scoring tiles representing various conditions (complete landscapes,
  whiskey barrels, lighthouses, animal groups, and more), but only 4 are chosen per
  game. Each is assigned a letter (A through D), and different letters score during
  different rounds — meaning point conditions escalate in importance as the game
  progresses. Players must read the active scoring conditions and adapt their
  tile-buying strategy accordingly, making every game feel distinct.

  Winner of the 2016 Kennerspiel des Jahres, the game is praised for elegantly
  combining tile-laying with an accessible economic auction mechanism that creates
  genuine strategic tension without excessive complexity.
