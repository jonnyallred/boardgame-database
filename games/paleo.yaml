# Description
description: |
  A cooperative adventure set in the Stone Age. Players work together to
  help their tribe survive the challenges of prehistoric life - gathering
  food, crafting tools, and fending off dangers. Each round, players
  simultaneously choose which locations to explore by looking at the backs
  of cards in their personal decks. The ultimate goal is to complete a
  cave painting of a woolly mammoth. Features a scenario-based campaign
  with increasing difficulty. Winner of the 2021 Kennerspiel des Jahres.
