# Description
description: |
  Paleo is a cooperative survival game set in the Stone Age, designed by Peter
  Rustemeyer and winner of the 2021 Kennerspiel des Jahres. Players work together
  as a tribe of prehistoric humans striving to survive and ultimately complete a
  cave painting — the game's central victory condition.

  Each player manages a small group of tribe members, each with their own skill
  and life points. On each turn, players simultaneously choose from face-down
  cards that reveal their contents only when committed to — a key tension mechanic
  that forces players to weigh risk versus reward. Cards may offer food, resources,
  crafted tools, or trigger dangers such as injuries, predators, or starvation.

  The game is built around 10 modular card sets that can be mixed and matched to
  vary the experience, difficulty, and narrative. Players lose if they accumulate
  five skull tokens — earned when tribe members die or go unfed. Victory comes
  from collecting all five cave painting tokens before the tribe is wiped out.

  Paleo is notable for its elegant risk-communication system: card backs hint at
  possible rewards and dangers without revealing them fully, creating genuine
  dilemmas each round. A solo mode is included. The first expansion, Paleo: A New
  Beginning, adds new modules and further story content.
