# Description
description: |
  A campaign-based cooperative experience spanning 12-24 game sessions
  representing one year. Players work as a disease-fighting team racing to
  cure diseases before they overwhelm the world. Actions have permanent
  consequences - characters gain scars, cities panic, and diseases mutate.
  Sealed packets reveal new rules and components as the story unfolds.
