# Description
description: |
  Eight-Minute Empire is a compact area control card game designed and illustrated by Ryan
  Laukat, published by Red Raven Games in 2012. Players take turns selecting one of six
  available action cards, paying the listed coin cost and immediately executing the action:
  placing or moving armies, building cities, and collecting sets of goods. The card chosen
  also adds to each player's hand for end-game set collection scoring. After all cards are
  purchased or the deck runs out, players score for area control across the map's regions
  and islands, plus bonus points for card set majorities. The game packs meaningful
  strategic decisions about area control, card timing, and set collection into a tiny
  footprint that plays in under 20 minutes. Its elegant design makes it a go-to filler
  or travel game for experienced gamers.
