# Description
description: |
  Blob Party is a cooperative party game where players start as solo individuals
  and must merge into one giant blob by giving matching answers to word prompts.
  Each player receives a small lump of sculpting dough and a colored googly eye;
  when two players write the same answer to a category-and-word card combination,
  they physically combine their dough blobs and play as a team from then on.
  The group has seven rounds to get every player into a single Mega Blob — winning
  together or failing as a fragmented mass of clay. Winner of the American Tabletop
  Awards Early Gamers category (2023).
