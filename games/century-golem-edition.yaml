description: |
  Century: Golem Edition is a re-themed version of Century: Spice Road, set in the fantasy world
  of Caravania where players are caravan leaders trading crystals to golems across enchanted lands.
  Each turn, players perform one of four actions: establish a trade route (play a card), make a
  trade or harvest crystals (use a card), fulfill a demand (meet a golem card's crystal requirements
  for points), or rest (reclaim played cards). Players build an engine of trading cards that
  convert one type of crystal into others, working toward the most valuable golem point cards.
  The game's beautiful golem artwork and crystal components replace the original's spice theme
  while preserving the elegant card-play and resource conversion mechanics. An excellent gateway
  to Euro games for families and new players.
