# Description
description: |
  BattleLore Second Edition is Fantasy Flight Games' redesign of Richard Borg's
  acclaimed fantasy wargame, set in the Runebound universe. Departing from the
  original's medieval-historical setting, the second edition features dedicated
  lore across two armies — the human Daqan Lords and the demon Uthuk Y'llan —
  each with unique units, stats, and abilities. The Commands & Colors hex-grid
  system is retained and refined: players play Command cards to activate units
  in specific flanks, then roll custom battle dice. The key innovation is custom
  army building before each scenario: players receive equal gold and select units
  from their army box, then secretly deploy on designated setup hexes. Victory
  point banners placed on the battlefield reward positional control, ensuring
  both sides must fight over key terrain rather than simply eliminating units.
