# Description
description: |
  Mosaic: A Story of Civilization is a competitive civilization-building game for 1-6 players
  in which each player leads an ancient civilization from humble beginnings through to a
  sprawling empire. Designed by Glenn Drover (Age of Empires III: The Age of Discovery,
  Railways of the World), the game distills civ-building into a streamlined action-selection
  framework that keeps games under two hours.

  At the start of each game, players choose one of nine asymmetric Leaders, each granting
  unique starting bonuses and special powers that shape their strategic approach. On each
  turn, a player selects one of eight available actions: Work (produce ideas, food, or
  stone), Population (pay food to grow your people), Build (construct cities, towns, or
  projects), Military (recruit units and assert dominance on the board), Technology
  (research cards that unlock powerful ongoing effects), Wonders (erect monumental
  structures for big end-game points), Achievement (claim civilization achievement tiles),
  or Golden Age (trigger an era-scoring event).

  The game is played across a modular map of seven regions representing the ancient
  Mediterranean world. Players expand their civilization through city and town placement,
  compete for area control, and develop technology trees that generate engine-like combos
  and synergies. Victory points are earned through multiple paths: technologies, golden
  age tiles, civilization achievements, wonders, and military presence, allowing players
  to pursue different strategic goals within the same game.

  Mosaic was funded on Kickstarter and released commercially in 2022. It is notable for
  delivering a full civilization-game experience — exploration, expansion, exploitation,
  and extermination — without the multi-hour commitment typical of the genre.
