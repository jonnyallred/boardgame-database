# Description
description: |
  Freedom: The Underground Railroad is a cooperative game published by Academy Games in
  2013 set during the American abolitionist movement. Players represent abolitionist
  organizations working together to guide escaped slaves along the Underground Railroad
  from the Deep South to freedom in Canada. Each round, slave catchers move toward slaves
  and threaten their capture, while players spend action points to move conductors and
  slaves northward, fund abolitionist societies, and purchase powerful supporter cards.
  Slaves caught are sent back south or sold, moving the game closer to defeat. Players
  win by moving a minimum number of slaves to freedom before the game end trigger; they
  lose if too many slaves are sold or if the team runs out of resources. The game is
  deeply educational, presenting its difficult subject matter with respect and historical
  accuracy, and is widely praised for its meaningful thematic resonance.
