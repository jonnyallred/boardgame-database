# Description
description: |
  A quick, fun game about buying and selling real estate. The game is played in two distinct phases. In the first phase, players bid for properties using an open auction system where they must either raise the bid or drop out, paying half their last bid (rounded up) to take the lowest-valued property. In the second phase, players simultaneously reveal one of their acquired properties in a blind auction to claim currency cards, with the lowest property receiving the lowest payment. The player who makes the most money wins.

  For Sale is considered one of the finest bidding games of all time, combining clever tactical decisions with simple rules that can be taught in minutes. Perfect as a filler game or gateway game for families and casual gamers, yet engaging enough for experienced players. The two-phase structure creates interesting decisions about when to commit resources and which properties to sell for maximum profit.
