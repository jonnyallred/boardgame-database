# Description
description: |
  For Sale is a quick, classic bidding card game about buying and selling real estate.
  The game unfolds in two distinct phases. In the first phase, players bid in open
  auctions to acquire property cards numbered 1 to 30, each representing a different
  piece of real estate — from a cardboard box to a space station. Players must either
  raise the bid or drop out, taking the lowest available property when they pass and
  losing half their bid (rounded down). In the second phase, players simultaneously
  reveal one of their acquired property cards face-down to compete for a spread of
  currency cards ranging from $0 to $15,000. The player who reveals the highest-valued
  property card takes the highest-value currency card, and so on down the line.

  Originally published in 1997 by Ravensburger/FX Schmid, For Sale has been reprinted
  in numerous editions and is widely regarded as one of the finest and most elegant
  filler games ever designed. It is praised for being easy to teach, playing in under
  30 minutes, and rewarding bluffing, timing, and hand management despite its simplicity.
