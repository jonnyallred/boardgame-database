# Description
description: |
  Castle Combo is a fast tableau-building card game in which players recruit
  characters from two open markets — a Castle row of nobles and a Village row
  of peasants — arranging them into a personal 3×3 grid. A shared Messenger
  pawn controls which market is active each turn, and spending Keys lets you
  redirect it or refresh the available cards. Each character triggers an
  immediate ability when placed and scores end-game points based on its grid
  position and the shields present in its row, column, or neighborhood.
  Balancing gold, keys, card adjacency, and shield-type sets makes every
  placement count, delivering a deceptively strategic puzzle that resolves in
  well under 30 minutes.
