description: |
  Deadwood is a fast-paced worker placement game with a deadly twist, set in the wild west town
  of Deadwood, South Dakota during the railroad era. Players deploy cowboys to buildings to annex
  them and use their special abilities — earning money and triggering powerful actions. Unlike most
  worker placement games, if an opponent's cowboy occupies a space you want, you can try to force
  your way in by initiating a shootout, rolling dice to determine who wins and who gets buried.
  Players must balance returning cowboys to their ranch for future deployment against claiming
  buildings to use their economic and combat powers. The high-risk, high-reward gunfight mechanic
  makes Deadwood more confrontational than typical worker placement games, with fortunes changing
  quickly as cowboys are eliminated and buildings change hands.
