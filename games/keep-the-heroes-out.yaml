# Description
description: |
  An asymmetric, cooperative dungeon defense game where players take on the role of monsters protecting their hard-earned treasures against invading hordes of looters (so-called heroes). In each turn, players draw 5 cards and use them to move, activate dungeon tiles, attack heroes, and coordinate their defenses. The goal is to survive 3 levels of threat from the invading heroes by protecting the treasures in each room. Features modular boards, variable player powers, and campaign-style scenarios for replayability.
