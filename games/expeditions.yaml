# Description
description: |
  Expeditions is a competitive, card-driven engine-building game of exploration set in an
  alternate history 1920s Siberia. A massive meteorite has crashed near the Tunguska River,
  releasing ancient corruption across the land. Players command dieselpunk mechs and animal
  companions, venturing into the wilderness to defeat corruption and claim the spoils of the
  expedition for personal profit.

  A standalone sequel to Scythe, Expeditions shares the same richly illustrated world by
  artist Jakub Rozalski but introduces a completely different ruleset. Each turn, players
  choose two of three core actions — Move, Gather, and Play — with the constraint that no
  action can be repeated from the previous turn. Playing cards from hand adds them to an
  active row, generating resources and abilities. Taking a rest turn forfeits actions but
  allows reclaiming all played cards, enabling powerful multi-action turns on the following
  round.

  Players build engines through workers, items, meteorites, and quests that augment their
  mech's capabilities. The hexagonal modular board reveals new location tiles as mechs
  explore, and spending power and guile allows players to vanquish corruption tokens worth
  victory points. Unlike Scythe, Expeditions features no direct player conflict — competition
  is indirect through map positioning and resource contention. The game scales well from solo
  play to five players, though the community consensus is that three or four players provides
  the best experience.
