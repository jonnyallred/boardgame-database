# Description
description: |
  San Marco is an area control game for 3-4 players set in the districts of
  Renaissance Venice. Players compete to build the greatest influence across
  the six districts of the city by placing aristocrats and manipulating bridges
  to control connections between regions.

  The game's central innovation is its "I Cut, You Choose" card distribution
  mechanism. Each round, one player acts as the Distributor, drawing a set of
  action cards and dividing them into as many piles as there are players. The
  other players each select a pile, and the Distributor takes the last
  remaining pile. This elegant asymmetry ensures tough decisions on both sides:
  the Distributor must anticipate what opponents want and craft piles that are
  bad for rivals without leaving themselves with the worst option, while
  choosers must read the piles strategically.

  Action cards allow players to place aristocrats in districts, move bridges to
  alter district connectivity, remove opponents' aristocrats, and score
  districts. The game is divided into three rounds, with scoring occurring
  during and at the end of each passage. Players earn points based on majority
  control of districts, with the value of districts varying depending on their
  size and the connections between them.

  Designed by Alan R. Moon and Aaron Weissblum and published by Ravensburger
  in 2001, San Marco is regarded as a tense and elegant Eurogame that rewards
  careful hand-reading and anticipation of opponents' priorities. It is
  particularly praised for the depth generated by its simple division mechanic.
