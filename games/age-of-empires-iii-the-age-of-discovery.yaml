# Description
description: |
  Age of Empires III: The Age of Discovery is a worker-placement and area-control
  game designed by Glenn Drover, inspired by the licensed Age of Empires computer
  game franchise. Two to five players command colonial European powers competing
  to explore, settle, and exploit the New World across three ages over eight
  turns. Workers (colonists) are placed in event spaces that resolve in a fixed
  order each round: discovery, colonization, trade, taxation, and capital
  development. The role-selection element grants the player who chose a phase a
  special bonus action. Players build colonial economies, dispatch ships, claim
  territory, and develop their home country's capabilities. The game was later
  rereleased as Empires: The Age of Discovery after the licensing agreement with
  Microsoft expired.
