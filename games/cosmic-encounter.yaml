# Description
description: |
  Conquer the galaxy with shifting alliances and the unique powers of your
  alien race. Each player leads an alien species with a game-breaking special
  power, competing to establish five colonies outside their home system.
  On your turn, destiny determines your target - then both sides invite
  allies and simultaneously play encounter cards. Negotiate deals or fight
  it out. With 50 unique alien powers in the base game, no two sessions
  play the same. A classic design originally from 1977, reimagined by
  Fantasy Flight Games with modern production and streamlined rules.
