description: |
  Defenders of the Wild is a cooperative area control game where players control different animal
  factions working together to stop a machine army from taking over their land. Players choose
  from four unique animal factions — the Council, the Order, the Sect, and the Coven — each with
  distinctive abilities and playstyles. Teams clear pollution, fight mechs, breach walls, build
  camps, and rewild factories across a highly modular hex board. The card-driven gameplay features
  hand management and push-your-luck elements. The game's ecological message is woven into its
  mechanics: every factory reclaimed is a victory for nature against industrial encroachment.
  Funded via Kickstarter, the game features 80 unique illustrated animal character cards and
  supports variable difficulty for both new and experienced cooperative gamers.
