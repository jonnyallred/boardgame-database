# Description
description: |
  Archipelago sets two to five players as rival European colonial powers exploring
  and developing a newly discovered island chain during the Age of Discovery. The
  modular board is built tile by tile as players explore, revealing new resources
  and opportunities. Gameplay blends resource management, area control, and worker
  placement as players build cities, harvest goods, and compete for dominance of
  each island. The semi-cooperative twist is a shared unrest track: if the native
  population revolts before the game ends, everyone loses, forcing players to
  collaborate on keeping social stability even as they compete individually. One
  player secretly holds a Separatist role and may actually want the rebellion to
  succeed. Secret individual objectives ensure that the victory conditions vary
  each game, making negotiation and reading opponents essential skills.
