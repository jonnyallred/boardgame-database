# Description
description: |
  A tile-laying path-builder in which players compete to guide rare butterflies
  to their personal flowerbeds. Each turn, place a hex path tile on the shared
  board and watch butterflies automatically slide as far as they can along newly
  connected routes. Butterflies score 1-3 points depending on their rarity, and
  players must cleverly route paths to claim the most valuable ones while
  blocking rivals. Since no player owns any path, the board becomes a web of
  shifting alliances and opportunistic redirects. A reimplementation of Knizia's
  Indigo (2012) with a vibrant butterfly theme and streamlined presentation.
  Best at 3-4 players where shared edge spaces create the richest tactical
  tension.
