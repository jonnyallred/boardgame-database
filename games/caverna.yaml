# Description
description: |
  Uwe Rosenberg's sprawling worker placement game where dwarven families
  build caves and farm simultaneously. Players dig rooms, cultivate fields,
  raise animals, and go on expeditions to gather resources. Unlike Agricola,
  there's no hand of cards to restrict options—anyone can do anything each
  round, creating a more open sandbox feel with less starvation tension.
  A massive array of cave rooms and furnishings provides enormous variety.
  Best at lower player counts where the action space stays competitive.
