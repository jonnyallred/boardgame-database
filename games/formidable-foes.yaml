description: |
  Formidable Foes is a light-hearted dungeon exploration game by Friedemann Friese where players
  take the roles of competing heroes accumulating treasure from monster-infested dungeons. Heroes
  explore the dungeon map, fight monsters, and collect gold — but the competition isn't against
  monsters, it's against other players to become the richest. On each turn, players choose to
  move twice, move once and fight a monster, or collect power tokens that improve dice rolls.
  Combat uses dice rolling with power tokens providing modifiers to improve odds. The real
  tension comes from race-to-riches dynamics as players grab available loot before rivals reach
  it. A lighthearted take on dungeon crawling that prioritizes accessible fun over strategic
  depth.
