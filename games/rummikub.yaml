# Description
description: |
  Rummikub is a tile-based game that blends the hand management of rummy with a shared
  tabletop puzzle. Players draw tiles numbered 1-13 in four colors (106 tiles total: 104
  numbered tiles plus two jokers) and race to empty their racks by forming valid sets on
  the table.

  On each turn a player may add tiles to existing sets, rearrange tiles already on the
  table into new configurations, or draw a tile as a penalty. The key twist is
  manipulation: players can split runs, swap tiles between groups, and restructure the
  entire tableau as long as every set on the table remains valid at the end of the turn.
  This "rummying" of the shared layout is what distinguishes the game from straight card
  rummy and gives it its name.

  An initial meld of at least 30 points is required before a player may begin adding to
  the table. The first player to play all of their tiles wins; remaining players score
  negative points equal to the tiles left on their rack. Jokers are wild but score 30
  penalty points if left in hand.

  Designed by Ephraim Hertzano in the 1940s and first manufactured in Israel by his
  family company Lemada Light Industries, Rummikub spread internationally in the 1970s
  and won the prestigious Spiel des Jahres (Game of the Year) award in 1980, cementing
  its status as one of the best-selling tile games of all time.
