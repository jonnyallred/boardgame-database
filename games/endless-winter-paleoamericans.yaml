# Description
description: |
  Endless Winter: Paleoamericans is a euro-style strategy game set in North America around
  10,000 BCE, where players guide the development of their tribes across several generations —
  from nomadic hunter-gatherers to prosperous tribal societies. Tribes migrate and settle new
  lands, establish cultural traditions, hunt paleolithic megafauna, and build everlasting
  megalithic structures.

  The game combines worker placement and deck building in an interwoven way: each round,
  players send tribe members to action spaces and pay for those actions by playing cards and
  spending resources. Tribe cards grant additional labor, while Culture cards provide unique
  ongoing effects and combo potential. Additional systems include area influence on a modular
  hex-tile map, set collection of animal hunt cards, and tile placement puzzles for building
  megaliths.

  Known for synthesizing many beloved euro mechanisms into a cohesive, combo-rich experience,
  Endless Winter rewards players who build efficient engines while offering enough accessible
  systems to feel manageable from the start. Higher player counts can introduce downtime as
  players construct elaborate turns. A robust solo mode designed by Drake Villareal is included.
