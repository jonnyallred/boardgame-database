# Description
description: |
  Age of Renaissance is a civilization-building game set in the European
  Renaissance, serving as a sequel to the classic Avalon Hill game Civilization.
  Three to six players each control one of the great commercial capitals of
  Europe — Venice, Genoa, Barcelona, London, Paris, or Hamburg — competing to
  gain prestige through technological advancement while keeping their misery
  index low. Players expand territory, accumulate trade cards representing
  commodities, and bid for the right to advance on tech trees covering areas
  like religion, exploration, arts, and commerce. A deck of event cards introduces
  historical crises including plagues, famines, and religious strife. The game
  won the Origins Award for Best Pre-20th Century Board Game of 1996 and is
  prized for its rich historical simulation and deep strategic web.
