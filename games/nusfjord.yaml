# Description
description: |
  Develop a Norwegian fishing village by placing workers to clear forests,
  build ships, and manage fishing operations in the Lofoten archipelago.
  Construct buildings to gain advantages and draft shares in your company
  to balance immediate benefits against end-game scoring. Part of Rosenberg's
  Harvest series, featuring a unique share-drafting mechanism alongside
  classic worker placement.
