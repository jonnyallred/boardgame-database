# Description
description: |
  Mount profitable expeditions to five lost cities by playing numbered
  cards in ascending order to your expedition columns. Each expedition
  costs 20 points to start, so you must carefully choose which to invest
  in and when to commit. Wager cards multiply your score but also your
  risk. A classic two-player card game with simple rules, tense decisions,
  and high replayability.
