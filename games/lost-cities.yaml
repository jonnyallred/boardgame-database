# Description
description: |
  Lost Cities is a 2-player card game in which players mount expeditions to five ancient
  locations: the Himalayas, the Brazilian rainforest, the Egyptian desert, an ancient volcano
  site, and the lost realm beneath the sea. The 60-card deck is divided into five color-coded
  suits, each containing cards numbered 2 through 10 and three wager/investment cards.

  On each turn a player plays or discards one card, then draws one card from either the deck
  or any discard pile. Cards in an expedition must be placed in ascending numerical order, so
  players must commit early and build upward. Beginning an expedition costs 20 points; played
  number cards contribute their face value. Wager cards, played before any numbered card in
  an expedition, multiply the final score (or loss) for that expedition by 2x, 3x, or 4x.

  The key tension is deciding which expeditions to start: starting too many spreads your hand
  thin, while skipping a promising suit means leaving points on the table. The game ends when
  the draw deck is exhausted, and three rounds are typically played with a final score tally.

  Lost Cities won the 1999 Meeples' Choice Award and the 2000 International Gamers Award. It
  is widely regarded as one of the finest two-player games ever designed and a classic
  introduction to hobby gaming for couples and non-gamers.
