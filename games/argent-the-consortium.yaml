# Description
description: |
  Argent: The Consortium is a cutthroat worker-placement game set in a magical
  university where players are archmages competing to become Chancellor. The
  twelve members of the Consortium will each vote for the candidate best matching
  their secret criteria — and those criteria are hidden from players at game start,
  revealed only as the game progresses. Workers (mages) are placed on action spaces
  to gather resources and cast spells, but opponents can blast your mages off the
  board or relocate them with powerful spell effects. This creates intense direct
  conflict unusual for the worker-placement genre. The combination of secret victory
  conditions, asymmetric player powers, and aggressive spell-casting makes every
  session play differently, rewarding both planning ahead and reactive
  counter-play.
