# Description
description: |
  Antike is a civilization-building game set in the ancient Mediterranean, where
  players guide Greek, Roman, Phoenician, Carthaginian, or other ancient nations
  through expansion, development, and rivalry. The signature mechanic is Mac
  Gerdts' rondel: a circular action selector with eight options — earn income,
  grow cities, build legions or galleys, sail, move, research technology, and
  temple construction — where players may advance their marker freely but must
  pay extra gold to skip ahead more than two spaces. Combat is deterministic
  with no dice, resolved simply by unit cancellation. Victory goes to the first
  player to collect nine ancient personages (like Aristotle or Caesar), earned
  by scientific achievements and territorial milestones. The rondel creates
  distinctive strategic tension by rationing how quickly any one action can be
  repeated.
