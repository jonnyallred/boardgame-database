description: |
  Captain Silver is a tactile children's dexterity game where players feel around inside a pirate
  bag to find the correct treasure object. When the active player gives the signal, everyone races
  to reach into their own pirate bag and grab the correct object matching the current challenge.
  Success earns treasure — but grabbing the wrong object means losing your turn. The game's
  simple premise — identify objects by touch alone — creates surprising excitement and frequent
  moments of comic failure as players confidently produce the wrong artifact. A 2017 Kinderspiel
  des Jahres nominee, Captain Silver is a family-friendly speed game that works across age groups
  due to its purely physical, non-verbal challenge.
