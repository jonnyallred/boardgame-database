# Description
description: |
  A two-player gem-acquisition duel set in the Renaissance. Players take turns
  claiming gem and gold tokens from a shared 5x5 grid, where only consecutive tokens
  in a row may be taken, creating gaps that limit future options for both players.
  Tokens fund the purchase of development cards that provide permanent gem bonuses
  and victory points. Three separate win conditions — reaching 20 points, acquiring
  10 crowns, or collecting 10 cards in a single color — create multiple paths to
  victory and force constant adaptation.
