# Description
description: |
  Wroth is an asymmetric dice-drafting area control game from Chip Theory Games,
  set on the island of Wroth where cultural factions vie for dominance of the
  Drudgeon Peninsula. Each round, a pool of custom dice — equal to twice the
  player count plus one — is rolled and drafted one at a time, with die faces
  representing different actions such as moving units, attacking, or activating
  special powers.

  Each faction has unique abilities and once-per-game powers that reward
  different playstyles. The game supports competitive, cooperative, and solo
  modes, and is notable for its quick setup, accessible teach time (~10 minutes),
  and distinctive trippy art aesthetic. Chip Theory Games' neoprene-and-chip
  component style makes it compact despite its strategic depth.
