# Description
description: |
  A tense two-player card game where players compete to win the favor
  of seven geisha masters by collecting their preferred performance
  items. Each round, players must choose four actions that force
  agonizing decisions: secretly hide a card, trade offerings, or split
  groups for your opponent to choose from. Elegant and deeply strategic
  despite its simple rules and short playtime.
