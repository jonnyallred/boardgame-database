# Description
description: |
  Recreate four centuries of history in the famous city of Troyes in the
  Champagne region of France. Manage your population across three domains -
  religious, military, and civil - represented by colored dice. Place workers
  to gain dice, then spend them on powerful action cards, fight off events,
  or build the cathedral. You can even buy opponents' dice. Hidden objective
  cards tied to each player keep everyone guessing about final scoring.
