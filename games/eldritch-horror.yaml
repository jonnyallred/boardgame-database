# Description
description: |
  Eldritch Horror is a cooperative Lovecraftian adventure game published by Fantasy Flight
  Games in 2013. Players take on the roles of investigators traveling the globe to close
  dimensional gates and gather clues to prevent an Ancient One from awakening and ending
  the world. The game features a world map spanning multiple continents, with investigators
  moving between cities and wilderness locations to battle monsters, solve mysteries, and
  collect artifacts. Three mystery cards must be solved before the Ancient One awakens,
  but the Doom Track steadily ticks down as crises and gate spawns accumulate. Each Ancient
  One provides unique win conditions, encounter decks vary by location type, and the
  investigator roster offers wildly different abilities and backstories. Eldritch Horror
  streamlines many mechanisms from Arkham Horror into a more accessible global adventure
  while retaining the tense, narrative-rich Cthulhu atmosphere.
