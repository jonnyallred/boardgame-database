# Description
description: |
  A cooperative adventure across the globe to stop an Ancient One from
  awakening. Investigators travel to cities and wilderness locations,
  gathering clues, acquiring assets, and fighting monsters drawn from
  H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos. Each Ancient One changes the game's
  mechanics and win conditions. Dice-based skill checks drive encounters
  while narrative cards create an emergent story. Spiritual successor to
  Arkham Horror with a streamlined global-scale design.
