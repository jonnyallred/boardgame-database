# Description
description: |
  Ankh: Gods of Egypt is Eric Lang's area control game set in ancient Egypt, where
  players take on the roles of rival gods — Ra, Osiris, Amun, Thoth, Isis, and
  others — competing for the devotion of the Egyptian people as monotheism rises
  and threatens to erase all but one deity from history.

  The game features streamlined rules with only four actions available each turn
  (move, summon a monster, gain ankh powers, or build a monument), but the
  asymmetric god powers and evolving board state create rich strategic depth.
  Players control areas of the map, wage battles for supremacy, and accumulate
  followers.

  A distinctive mechanic in three-to-five player games is the Merge: when a god
  falls too far behind, they merge with another god to form a single powerful
  combined deity. This reduces player elimination while creating interesting
  alliance dynamics. Ankh completes Lang's ancient civilization trilogy alongside
  Blood Rage and Rising Sun, and is celebrated for its accessible ruleset and
  stunning production values.
