# Description
description: |
  Journey over rough seas, majestic mountains, vast deserts, and lush
  grasslands to establish trade routes between cities. A flip-and-place
  game where terrain cards are revealed and players simultaneously place
  explorer cubes on their personal map boards. Complete areas, discover
  villages, establish new cities, explore shipwrecks for treasure, and
  create trade routes between cities to earn coins. The game plays over
  four eras with explorers removed between rounds but discoveries
  remaining. Link two cities in the same era to create valuable trade
  routes. Praised for its excellent solo mode and simultaneous play
  that scales well at all player counts.
