# Description
description: |
  Sandbox-style competitive space adventure where players captain starships
  across a modular galaxy. Choose your path: trade cargo between planets,
  mine asteroids, salvage wrecks, complete missions, or attack other players.
  Customize your ship by upgrading engines, weapons, shields, and cargo holds.
  Start with a small Tier 1 vessel and work your way up to massive Tier 3
  warships. The first captain to earn enough Fame Points wins. Every game
  creates a unique galaxy through modular hex tiles revealed during exploration.
