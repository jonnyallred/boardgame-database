# Description
description: |
  Players divide into two teams: Viking invaders (Norsemen and Berserkers) or
  English defenders (King's Housecarls and Thegns) battling for control of
  9th-century England. Each faction has unique cards for movement and custom
  dice for combat resolution. Leaders like Halfdan and Alfred provide strategic
  advantages and reinforcements. The game ends when players trigger the Treaty
  of Wedmore, with victory going to whoever controls the most territory. Winner
  of the 2017 Golden Geek Best War Game award.
