# Description
description: |
  A tile-laying city-building game where players construct their own economic
  engines to maximize population growth. Using hex-shaped building tiles, add
  residential, commercial, civic, and industrial areas. Buildings interact
  with adjacent tiles and other players' cities, creating a complex economic
  web. Balance income, reputation, and population growth while managing
  hidden goals. Winner of the 2013 Mensa Select award.
