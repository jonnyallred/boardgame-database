# Description
description: |
  Deep Sea Adventure is a press-your-luck game published by Oink Games in which players
  share a single submarine and compete to collect the most valuable treasure from the ocean
  floor. Players take turns rolling dice to move their diver deeper into the ocean, picking
  up treasure tokens. However, the submarine uses a shared oxygen supply, and every piece
  of treasure held by any diver reduces the oxygen consumption each turn. Players must
  decide when to turn back before the oxygen runs out — anyone still in the water when
  oxygen reaches zero loses all their collected treasure. Treasure is only scored if the
  diver returns safely to the submarine. The tension escalates as divers grab more loot
  but risk losing everything, making each decision a nail-biting gamble.
