# Description
description: |
  The original civilization card game in which players guide a nation from antiquity
  to the modern era, drafting leaders, technologies, wonders, and military cards from
  a shared row. Civil and military action points constrain what you can accomplish
  each turn, forcing agonizing trade-offs between growth, production, science, and
  culture. Military strength matters not just for attacking rivals but for defending
  against political events. This 2006 edition was later revised into "Through the
  Ages: A New Story of Civilization" in 2015 with streamlined rules and updated cards.
