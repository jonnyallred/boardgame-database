# Description
description: |
  Elysium is a card drafting and set collection game published by Space Cowboys in 2015
  set in ancient Greek mythology. Players compete to recruit legendary demigods and heroes
  into their service, building powerful card combinations in the mortal realm before
  transferring them to Elysium for scoring. Cards belong to one of eight families (each
  associated with a Greek god), and each family has unique abilities and scoring conditions.
  The key strategic tension lies in timing transfers: cards score only once moved to
  Elysium, but they lose their active abilities. Players must also collect columns
  (matching card levels) and domains (matching card families) to qualify for specific
  scoring conditions at game end. With five different family combinations active each
  game, Elysium offers significant variability and rewards players who master its
  interconnected card synergies.
