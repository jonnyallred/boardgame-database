# Description
description: |
  Keltis is a multi-player board game designed by Reiner Knizia that won the
  Spiel des Jahres (Game of the Year) award in 2008. It is thematically set
  among ancient Celtic stone paths and expands the mechanics of Knizia's
  two-player card game Lost Cities into a 2-4 player board game experience.
  In the US it was published as Lost Cities: The Board Game.

  Each player has a hand of cards showing one of five colors/symbols and a
  number from 0-10 (each value appearing twice). On their turn, a player plays
  a card from their hand to one of the five colored paths, then draws a card
  from the draw pile or from one of the face-up discard piles. Cards played to
  a path must follow in ascending or descending order — players must commit to
  a direction once the second card is placed. Playing a card advances one of
  the player's tokens along the corresponding stone path on the board.

  Scoring is path-based: advancing fewer than 4 steps on a path yields negative
  points, while 4 or more steps earn positive points. Each player has one taller
  "doubling" token whose path score is counted twice. Bonus points are awarded
  for collecting wishing stones (found on certain path spaces) and landing on
  special bonus squares. The game ends when any player has advanced all five of
  their tokens, or when the draw pile is exhausted.

  The family-friendly rules, quick play time, and meaningful decisions about
  which cards to play and which to discard made Keltis a popular gateway game
  and a worthy Spiel des Jahres winner.
