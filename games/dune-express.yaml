description: |
  Dune Express is a simplified adaptation of the classic Dune board game designed to be played
  in under 30 minutes. Released as a print-and-play game, it attempts to capture the strategic
  faction-conflict and alliance mechanics of the original Dune board game by replacing complex
  tactical rules with a streamlined Yahtzee-style dice resolution system. The resulting game
  retains the strategic faction selection, alliance negotiation, and political maneuvering that
  made the original Dune famous while dramatically reducing setup and play time. The six Dune
  factions each retain their asymmetric powers, and the core gameplay tension of shifting
  alliances and betrayal is preserved. Limited information is available about this game as
  it existed primarily in print-and-play format.
