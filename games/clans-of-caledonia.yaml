# Description
description: |
  A clan-based economic strategy game set in 19th-century Scotland. Each player
  leads a unique Scottish clan with a special economic power and works to settle
  the landscape, produce goods, and fulfill profitable export contracts. A shared
  market tracks supply and demand — flooding it with a commodity drives its price
  down, punishing both you and competitors. Export contracts scored throughout
  the game create a tense, interconnected economy. Often compared to Terra Mystica
  for its modular map and asymmetric faction design.
