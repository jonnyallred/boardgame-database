# Description
description: |
  Mid-to-heavy economic game set in 19th-century Scotland during the
  transition from agriculture to industrialization. Each player represents
  a historic Scottish clan with unique abilities, competing to produce,
  trade, and export agricultural goods and whisky. Features a dynamic
  market where prices fluctuate based on supply and demand, modular hex
  board for high replayability, and 5 rounds of tight economic decisions.
  Eight possible actions per turn including building, upgrading, trading,
  and fulfilling export contracts.
