# Description
description: |
  At the Gates of Loyang, the final entry in Uwe Rosenberg's Harvest Trilogy
  alongside Agricola and Le Havre, tasks one to four players with running a
  vegetable stall outside ancient China's trading capital. Each round, players
  receive cards representing fields, customers, helpers, and shops through a
  clever shared-draw system: each player draws two cards and keeps one, while
  the card they discard into a public pool becomes available to any player willing
  to pay for it. Planted fields yield vegetables each turn, which are used to
  fulfill regular customers for steady income or one-time customers for immediate
  gold. Helper cards provide special abilities that can boost efficiency. The
  game's central tension is a prosperity track with exponentially increasing costs
  to advance, rewarding both early commitment and precise resource chains.
