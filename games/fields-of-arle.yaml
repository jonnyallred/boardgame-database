# Description
description: |
  Build up a farming village in East Frisia across six seasons of worker placement.
  Cultivate fields, raise animals, harvest peat, and construct buildings to score
  points — all with just two workers shared between the players. The game alternates
  between summer and winter phases, each offering different action spaces and
  forcing tough choices about development priorities. Uwe Rosenberg's most beloved
  two-player-focused design.
