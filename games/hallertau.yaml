# Description
description: |
  Manage a Bavarian hop farm in the Hallertau region, cultivating fields,
  developing your community, and crafting goods. Worker placement spots
  become increasingly expensive as they are used, creating a dynamic
  action economy. A quintessential Rosenberg experience with card-driven
  combos layered over satisfying agricultural resource conversion.
