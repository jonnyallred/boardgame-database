# Description
description: |
  Marvel Dice Throne Missions is a cooperative expansion for the Dice Throne system that
  pits 1-4 heroes against iconic villains from the Marvel Universe. Players choose their
  heroes from any Dice Throne set — Marvel or otherwise — and work together across a series
  of double-sided mission maps, each presenting unique objectives and escalating challenges.

  Scenarios chain together into a narrative arc, with each mission providing objectives
  that culminate in a climactic boss battle showdown. Progress is tracked on a universal
  perks sheet, allowing players to carry improvements forward between sessions without
  locking in specific heroes. The cooperative format requires players to coordinate dice
  rolls, card play, and hero abilities to overcome increasingly dangerous villain encounters.

  The game is not standalone and requires at least one Dice Throne hero set per player.
  It is compatible with all existing Dice Throne characters, making it a versatile
  cooperative layer for the entire Dice Throne ecosystem.
