# Description
description: |
  7 Empires is a strategic area-influence game by Mac Gerdts (designer of Concordia) set in 18th century Europe during the Age of Ancien Régime. Players do not control a single nation but instead compete to manipulate the policies of seven historical empires — Great Britain, France, Prussia, Russia, the Habsburg Empire, the Ottoman Empire, and Spain — for their own political and military benefit. The game features a Rondel-based action selection system that governs the movement of frigates, ships of the line, infantry, and artillery across a map of Europe. Victory goes to the player who achieves supreme dominance through shrewd alliances, investment, and diplomatic maneuvering. With compact rules but a multitude of challenging decisions, 7 Empires rewards long-term strategic foresight and careful management of shared power.
