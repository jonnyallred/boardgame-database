description: |
  De Vulgari Eloquentia is a historical strategy game set in late medieval Italy where players
  participate in creating the Volgare — the vernacular language spoken by common people, derived
  from various regional Italian dialects. Players use action points to read manuscripts, travel
  between cities, improve social status (becoming bankers, climbing church hierarchies), and
  spread specific dialects. The game features a track movement system for social advancement and
  variable turn order based on player stats. Victory goes to the player who accumulates the most
  Volgare points through their scholarly and political activities. The unusual theme of linguistic
  unification combined with social climbing mechanics creates a distinctive Euro experience that
  rewards careful planning and efficient use of limited actions.
