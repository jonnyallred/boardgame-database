# Description
description: |
  Compete for influence over three castes -- samurai, priests, and
  peasants -- to unite feudal Japan under your rule. Players place
  hexagonal influence tiles on a modular map of Japan, vying for
  majority around cities and villages that contain caste tokens. The
  board scales by adding island segments for higher player counts.
  One of Knizia's classic tile-laying designs with elegant scoring
  and deep spatial decisions.
