# Description
description: |
  Wealthy citizens of medieval Prague organize building projects to gain the
  king's favor. Players choose from six actions on the action crane, each
  weighted with constantly shifting costs and benefits. Build iconic Prague
  landmarks including the Hunger Wall, St. Vitus Cathedral, the Charles Bridge,
  and Charles University. Features a unique action selection mechanism where
  tile placement on the crane determines available bonuses and costs, creating
  layered strategic and tactical decisions.
