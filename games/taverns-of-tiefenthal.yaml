# Description
description: |
  The Taverns of Tiefenthal is a deck-building dice-drafting game for 2-4 players designed by
  Wolfgang Warsch (The Mind, The Quacks of Quedlinburg). Players take the role of tavern owners
  in the small village of Tiefenthal, competing to build the most successful establishment over
  eight rounds. Each round, players draft dice to attract patrons (earning coins and points),
  buy new cards to strengthen their deck, and upgrade their tavern with new rooms and features.
  The modular expansion system built into the base game introduces additional rule modules
  that can be added incrementally, allowing the game to grow in complexity as players become
  more experienced. The deck-building and dice-drafting mechanisms interweave elegantly, with
  the quality of your card deck directly affecting the power of your dice placements. Published
  by Schmidt Spiele, it received widespread acclaim for its layered but approachable design.
