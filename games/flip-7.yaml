# Description
description: |
  Flip 7 is a fast-playing press-your-luck card game for 3 to 18 players. The deck
  contains numbered cards from 1 to 12, with each number appearing as many times as
  its face value (one 1, two 2s, three 3s, and so on), plus a set of action and
  modifier cards.

  Each round, the active player flips over cards one at a time, adding them to their
  row. If a number comes up that they already have in their row, they bust and score
  zero for the round. At any point a player may choose to stop and bank their current
  total. The trick: the deck is shared, so every card you flip changes the odds for
  everyone else. If you manage to collect exactly 7 unique numbered cards, you
  immediately end the round and earn a 15-point bonus on top of your total.

  Players race to be the first to reach 200 points across multiple rounds. Action
  cards can freeze opponents, steal cards, or force other players to flip. The game
  plays in about 20 minutes and is easy to learn in minutes, making it a strong
  opener or closer for any game night.

  Flip 7 won the Origins Award for Best Card Game (2025) and the Golden Geek Award
  for Best Party Game, and was nominated for the Spiel des Jahres. It spent over
  10 weeks atop bestseller charts and quickly became one of the breakout hits of 2024.
