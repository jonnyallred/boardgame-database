# Description
description: |
  Happy City is a light card-drafting and tableau-building game in which 2-5 players compete
  to build the happiest city. Each player begins with a single building — the Happy Market —
  and over the course of the game purchases additional building cards from a shared marketplace,
  adding up to nine more cards to grow their city.

  Building cards provide one of two resources: citizens (population) or hearts (happiness).
  At game end, a player's score is the product of their total citizens multiplied by their
  total hearts — a simple multiplication that rewards balance. A player who focuses purely
  on population or happiness will score far less than one who develops both in tandem. The
  game ends as soon as one player adds their tenth card to their city.

  The game includes a family version and an advanced expert version, the latter featuring
  bonus buildings and greater interaction between players. Happy City was originally published
  in French by Cocktail Games and received an English-language release from Gamewright in 2021.
  It is praised as an accessible, fast-playing gateway game that can also gently introduce
  younger players to multiplication concepts.
