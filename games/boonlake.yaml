# Description
description: |
  Boonlake sends one to four pioneer players to settle the untamed shores of a
  fictional American lake region, building homes, raising cattle, and developing
  infrastructure in an undiscovered landscape. Players place tiles to expand the
  lake terrain, construct settlements, and link their growing territory to the
  emerging network of roads and rivers. Alexander Pfister's signature interlocking
  action systems reward long-term planning: cattle ranching generates ongoing
  income, while building developments unlock escalating bonuses. A card-driven
  action mechanism (similar to Pfister's Great Western Trail) paces players through
  decision trees where the order and timing of actions ripples across multiple
  future turns. Both competitive and solo modes are supported, with a modular board
  ensuring high replayability.
