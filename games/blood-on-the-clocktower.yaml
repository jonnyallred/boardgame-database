# Description
description: |
  A social deduction game for large groups where villagers try to deduce and
  eliminate the Demon hiding among them before it kills enough townsfolk to win.
  Unlike similar games, dead players remain engaged by still voting and gathering
  information, and a Storyteller moderates the game with significant narrative
  latitude. Each of the unique character roles has special abilities that generate
  information, create chaos, or manipulate the game state. Widely considered the
  pinnacle of the social deduction genre.
