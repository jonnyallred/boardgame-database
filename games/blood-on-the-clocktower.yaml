# Description
description: |
  A social deduction game for 5-20 players set in the village of
  Ravenswood Bluff. Each player receives a secret role with a unique
  ability. The evil Demon kills villagers at night while good players
  use information abilities to deduce who the Demon is. Unlike
  Werewolf, eliminated players remain in the game and continue to
  participate. A dedicated Storyteller moderates, managing the grimoire
  and crafting a dynamic narrative. Features three built-in scripts
  (Trouble Brewing, Sects & Violets, Bad Moon Rising) of escalating
  complexity, plus tools for custom scripts. Winner of numerous
  awards and widely regarded as the pinnacle of social deduction games.
