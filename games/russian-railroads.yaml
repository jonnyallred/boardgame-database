# Description
description: |
  Set in late 19th century Russia, players are railway magnates competing
  to build the most impressive railroad network. Using worker placement,
  players advance tracks along three routes (Trans-Siberian, St. Petersburg,
  Kiev), acquire increasingly powerful locomotives, recruit engineers with
  unique abilities, and develop industry. Different colored track segments
  score escalating points, creating a satisfying engine-building arc.
  Strategic depth comes from choosing which routes to prioritize and
  timing upgrades for maximum scoring combos.
