# Description
description: |
  Dogfight in the Star Wars universe with beautifully pre-painted
  miniatures. Each round, players secretly select maneuver dials for
  their ships, then simultaneously reveal and execute movements on a
  tabletop battlefield. Attack with custom dice, modify results with
  pilot abilities and upgrade cards, and outmaneuver your opponent.
  Build custom squadrons from a vast library of ships, pilots, and
  upgrades spanning the original trilogy and beyond. The core set
  includes one X-Wing and two TIE Fighters.
