# Description
description: |
  Blink is a lightning-fast two-player card game designed by Reinhard Staupe and
  marketed as the world's fastest game. Both players simultaneously play cards
  from their 30-card hand onto two central discard piles; a card may be played
  if it matches the top card of a pile by color, shape, or count. There are no
  turns — both players play as fast as they can. The first player to empty their
  hand wins. With 60 cards depicting six shapes in five colors and five quantities
  (1-5 symbols), every game takes under five minutes and requires lightning
  reflexes and quick pattern recognition rather than strategic planning. The
  simple premise makes it universally accessible while providing genuinely
  competitive intensity.
