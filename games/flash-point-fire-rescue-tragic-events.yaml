  Flash Point: Fire Rescue - Tragic Events is an expansion for the cooperative firefighting game
  Flash Point: Fire Rescue. It introduces a deck of 42 unique event cards that replace the Hot
  Spot mechanic from the Experienced game rules, adding unpredictable complications and dramatic
  moments to each rescue mission. Special Points of Interest — eight unique locations with
  extraordinary challenges — further vary scenarios. The expansion also adds three new specialist
  miniatures: the Strategist, Suppression Specialist, and Fire Prevention Specialist, each with
  unique abilities that expand team-building options. The event cards ensure no two games play
  the same way, dramatically extending the replayability of the base game.
