description: |
  Goa is a strategy game set at the beginning of the 16th century where players control competing
  spice trading companies vying for dominance. The game uniquely combines an interactive auction
  mechanism with solo management of plantations and fleet infrastructure. Players nominate tiles
  for auction — items other players want — earning money, then spend winnings to develop their
  own trading empire across five technology tracks: ships, plantations, colonists, spices, and
  expedition speed. Upgrading tracks unlocks more powerful actions and resources. The tension
  comes from always having one action fewer than you need, forcing tight prioritization each round.
  Players race to be first to reach the top levels in multiple tracks while balancing their
  income from selling spices overseas.
