# Description
description: |
  Lead a noble family in Renaissance Florence, deploying family members
  to gain resources, develop territories, and activate powerful card
  effects. Dice rolled each round determine the strength of all players'
  workers, forcing tactical adaptation. Collect development cards across
  four towers, manage military and faith tracks to avoid excommunication,
  and build an engine of lasting victory points.
