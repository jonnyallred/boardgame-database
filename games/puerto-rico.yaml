# Description
description: |
  Classic Euro role-selection game set in colonial Puerto Rico. Each round,
  players take turns choosing roles (Mayor, Builder, Craftsman, Captain, etc.)
  that activate for everyone but give the chooser a bonus. Produce goods with
  colonists, construct buildings for special powers, and ship goods to Europe
  for victory points. The tension between building an engine and shipping for
  points is timeless. One of the most influential Euros ever designed.
