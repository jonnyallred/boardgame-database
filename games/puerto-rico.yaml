# Description
description: |
  Assume the role of a colonial governor on the island of Puerto Rico.
  Each round, players select roles such as Builder, Mayor, Trader, Captain,
  and Craftsman, granting all players the associated action while giving
  the selector a privilege bonus. Construct buildings to gain advantages,
  grow and ship goods for victory points, and manage your plantation
  workforce to build the most prosperous colony. A landmark Euro design
  that pioneered the role-selection mechanism.
