# Description
description: |
  Imperium: Horizons is a standalone asymmetric civilization-building card game for 1-4 players in which each player leads one of fourteen historically-inspired peoples — from the Abbasids and Aksumites to the Inuit and Polynesians — charting their rise from barbarian beginnings to a thriving empire. Each civilization has a unique deck with a private market ensuring thematic accuracy, and players build their tableau by acquiring cards from a central market while managing expansion, scientific advancement, and cultural development. A central innovation is the new trade module, where Trade Route cards enable positive-sum economic interactions between players, replacing destructive take-that mechanics with cooperative wealth-generation opportunities. As a standalone product, Horizons includes a fully rewritten rulebook and quality-of-life improvements, while also offering nearly 50 replacement cards that integrate the trade module into Imperium: Classics and Imperium: Legends for owners of those sets.
