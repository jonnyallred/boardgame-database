# Description
description: |
  51st State: Ultimate Edition is the definitive all-in-one package for Ignacy
  Trzewiczek's post-apocalyptic card-engine game, bundling the base game with six
  expansions: New Era, Winter, Scavengers, Allies, Moloch, and No Man's Land.
  Set in a devastated America where new nation-states battle for supremacy, each
  player builds an engine from multi-use location cards: any card can be played
  to its face (building a permanent location), razed for immediate resources, or
  used to forge a deal for recurring production. Managing the tension between
  building a long-term engine and fueling short-term needs is the game's
  strategic core. Variable player factions with asymmetric starting states ensure
  each game plays differently. The Ultimate Edition consolidates years of
  expansion content into a streamlined package with refined components.
