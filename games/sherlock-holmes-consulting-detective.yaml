# Description
description: |
  Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective is a cooperative deduction game originally published by Sleuth
  Productions in 1981, winning the Spiel des Jahres in 1985. The game is currently published by Space
  Cowboys (an Asmodee label), which began releasing new standalone case collections starting in 2016.

  The game has no board, no dice, no tokens — only booklets of case text, detailed maps of Victorian
  London, replica newspapers, and a directory of addresses. Players are assigned a mystery to solve:
  they choose which leads to pursue by selecting numbered entries to read aloud from the casebook, visiting
  locations, interviewing suspects, and piecing together clues from newspapers. Once satisfied, players
  answer a series of questions about the case, then read Holmes's own solution. Points are awarded based
  on how efficiently players solved the case compared to the great detective himself.

  Multiple standalone volumes exist, including The Thames Murders & Other Cases, Carlton House & Queen's
  Park, and others. Each set contains 10 fully self-contained mysteries. The game is celebrated for its
  rich narrative immersion and the genuine intellectual satisfaction of cracking a well-constructed mystery.
