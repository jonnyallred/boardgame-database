# Description
description: |
  Command one of four Warhammer 40,000 factions — Ultramarines, Eldar,
  Orks, or Chaos Space Marines — battling for control of the Herakon
  Cluster. Place order tokens face-down in a stacking system that creates
  bluffing and timing tension. Resolve orders to dominate systems, deploy
  forces, strategize upgrades, or advance armies into combat. Battles
  combine dice rolling with tactical combat card play. Capture your
  objectives across a modular hex map to claim victory.
