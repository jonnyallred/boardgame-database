description: |
  Fury of Dracula (Third Edition) is an asymmetric hidden movement game set in Victorian-era Europe,
  based on Bram Stoker's novel. One player controls Count Dracula as he travels secretly across
  Europe, spreading his vampiric influence and creating new vampires, while one to four hunters
  work together to track him down. Dracula moves in secret using a separate board, placing
  encounter cards along his trail, and can only be caught when hunters reach his current location.
  Hunters must manage their resources, travel across the continent, and use deduction to narrow
  down Dracula's position before he accumulates enough influence to win. Combat uses simultaneous
  card play, making confrontations tense and unpredictable. The third edition streamlined rules
  from earlier editions and added rumor tokens to allow Dracula to mislead the hunters.
