# Description
description: |
  Hoist your flag and recruit the finest pirate crew on the seven seas. Each
  turn, draw a tile from the bag and decide: keep it as-is, or flip it to reveal
  the other side — then drop it into any column on your personal board, Connect
  4-style. Nine distinct pirate characters populate the tiles, each with a unique
  ability: Monkeys flip adjacent tiles, Gunners reward coins, Parrots let you
  draw again, and so on. Beware — collecting three Gunners triggers an instant
  loss. The game ends when any player completes four columns; the pirate with the
  most coins wins.

  With four different player boards offering varied tactical approaches and zero
  setup time, Captain Flip delivers snappy, luck-infused fun in under 20 minutes.
  A Spiel des Jahres 2024 nominee praised for its accessible rules, charming
  pirate art, and the delicious tension of every bag draw.
