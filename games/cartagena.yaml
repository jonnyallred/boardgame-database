# Description
description: |
  Cartagena is a pirate escape game themed on the 1672 jailbreak from the
  fortress of Cartagena. Two to five players each control six pirate pawns racing
  through a winding underground tunnel to reach the getaway sloop at the harbor.
  On a turn, a player plays a card from their hand to advance one pirate forward
  to the next empty space matching the card's symbol — or moves a pirate backward
  to the nearest occupied space to draw cards (one or two depending on how many
  pirates are already there). This elegant push-pull between advancing pirates
  and drawing cards creates clever tension. The modular board, composed of six
  double-sided tiles each with a different arrangement of six symbols, ensures
  the tunnel layout changes every game. The first player to get all six pirates
  onto the waiting ship wins.
