# Description
description: |
  Kemet: Blood and Sand is a revised and updated edition of the original Kemet (2012),
  published by Matagot in 2021. Players take on the roles of Egyptian gods commanding
  armies across a modular desert map, competing to accumulate victory points through
  battle, temple control, and divine power upgrades.

  Each turn, players take actions from a fixed pool — moving troops, building pyramid
  levels, recruiting units, and acquiring Power Tiles. The Power Tile market is the
  strategic heart of the game: four color-coded tracks (red, blue, white, black) offer
  a wide range of asymmetric abilities, mythological creatures, and combat bonuses that
  players combine to create powerful synergies. Reaching higher pyramid levels unlocks
  stronger tiles, and each color represents a distinct strategic philosophy.

  Combat is card-driven and fast-playing: both attacker and defender secretly choose a
  battle card, then reveal simultaneously. Defeated units retreat rather than being
  eliminated, keeping armies relevant throughout the game. The revised edition streamlines
  the original rules, rebalances Power Tiles, incorporates content from the Ta-Seti
  expansion (as a built-in fourth tile set), and introduces a dedicated turn order and
  victory point tracking board, Veteran Tokens, and updated victory conditions.

  Kemet: Blood and Sand rewards aggression — players score points primarily by winning
  battles and holding temples — making it one of the most openly confrontational area
  control games in the hobby. Games play to a fixed victory point threshold (typically
  8-9 points) and can end rapidly once a leader emerges, ensuring tight tension
  throughout.
