# Description
description: |
  Lead an Egyptian army to glory by controlling temples, purchasing powerful
  mythological power tiles, and engaging in brutal combat. The revised edition
  streamlines rules from the original Kemet while adding new powers and
  components. Victory demands aggression, as defensive play is actively
  discouraged by the scoring system.
