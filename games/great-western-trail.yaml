# Description
description: |
  Great Western Trail places players in the roles of 19th-century cattle ranchers repeatedly
  driving their herds from the grazing lands of Texas along the great trail to the railheads
  of Kansas City, where the cattle are shipped east by train. On each turn players move their
  cattleman along the trail, taking actions at buildings they pass—buying and selling cattle,
  hiring workers (cowboys, craftsmen, or engineers), constructing private buildings, and
  advancing their train network. The game's deck-building system underpins the cattle hand,
  where players acquire new cattle cards and cull weaker ones to deliver ever-more-valuable
  herds. Three distinct strategic paths—cattle breeding, infrastructure building, and train
  advancement—interlock into a rich engine-building puzzle that rewards long-term planning
  while demanding tactical adaptation to an ever-changing trail landscape.
