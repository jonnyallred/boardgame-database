# Description
description: |
  Luthier transports players to the height of classical music in Western Europe,
  where the art of the instrument was upheld equally by skilled craftspeople, noble
  patrons, virtuoso performers, and famous composers such as Bach, Beethoven, and Mozart.

  Using a novel combination of hidden bidding and worker placement, players manage
  resources to craft over 22 distinct musical instruments in their workshops, while
  courting actual historic patrons through an ever-changing personal tableau of actions
  and bonuses. Workers represent members of the player's family, each a chip numbered
  1 through 5 denoting their skill level. Players begin with three workers (levels 1, 3,
  and 5) and acquire their level 2 and 4 workers during play.

  Over six rounds, players bid their workers to claim action locations — gaining or
  repairing instruments, wooing patrons, performing in concerts, or trading at market —
  while racing to claim first-chair positions in the grand orchestra. Skill tracks unlock
  specialized worker abilities and bonuses, and multiple paths to victory reward
  instrument building, performances, apprentice training, workshop expansion, and
  overall reputation as a master instrument maker.

  Designed by Dave Beck and Abraham Burson (with over a decade of development) and
  published by Paverson Games in 2025, Luthier quickly appeared on numerous end-of-year
  top-ten lists for its elegant integration of bidding tension and Euro-style engine building.
