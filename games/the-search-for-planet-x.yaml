# Description
description: |
  Players compete as astronomers racing to locate the mysterious Planet X lurking
  at the edge of our solar system. A companion app generates a unique, randomized
  puzzle each game; players spend action points to scan sectors, attend conferences,
  and publish theories about the objects they discover. Logical deduction is key —
  clues gained narrow down which sector hides Planet X, but opponents are watching
  your every move. The first to correctly locate Planet X and publish their findings
  wins.
