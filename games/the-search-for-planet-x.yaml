  Take on the role of an astronomer searching for the hypothetical Planet X
  at the edge of our solar system. Use the companion app to survey sectors,
  target scan for objects, and research topics, then apply logic rules to
  deduce the locations of space objects and Planet X itself. Publish theories
  to earn points and race to locate Planet X before your rivals. A modern
  logic deduction game that elegantly uses app integration to create a unique
  competitive puzzle experience.
