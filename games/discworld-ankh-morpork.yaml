# Description
description: |
  Discworld: Ankh-Morpork is an area control game designed by Martin Wallace set in
  Terry Pratchett's beloved Discworld universe, published by Treefrog Games in 2011.
  Players take on roles of factions vying for control of the city of Ankh-Morpork,
  each with a secret victory condition dealt at the start of the game. One player might
  need to control certain districts, another might need to build a certain number of
  buildings, another might be trying to cause chaos. Cards are played to place minions,
  build businesses, create trouble, and use faction-specific abilities tied to iconic
  Discworld characters like Commander Vimes, Lord Vetinari, and Havelock Vetinari.
  The hidden victory conditions create bluffing and deduction elements, as players try
  to figure out opponents' goals while pursuing their own. The game is rich with Pratchett
  humor and references that fans will delight in.
