# Description
description: |
  Altiplano is a bag-building game set in the South American Andean highlands, where
  players take on the roles of residents trying to make a living through farming,
  fishing, mining, and trading in a landscape of limited resources.

  Like Orleans (Reiner Stockhausen's previous game), Altiplano uses a bag of tokens
  that players draw from each round to power their actions. But where Orleans uses
  a town board, Altiplano adds a variable modular map and a rondel-like movement
  system: players move their character around the board to access different locations
  and resource types, adding a spatial element to the familiar bag-building formula.

  Players convert basic resources into more valuable goods, score points for completed
  shipments and stored resources, and race to fill their market carts. The interplay
  between bag composition, character position, and available resources creates a
  rich optimization puzzle that plays out differently each game.
