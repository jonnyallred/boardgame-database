# Description
description: |
  Pandemic: Fall of Rome is a cooperative board game for 1-5 players set in
  the waning years of the Western Roman Empire, around 395 AD. Players take
  on specialized roles and work together to prevent five invading barbarian
  tribes — including the Visigoths, Vandals, Saxons, Franks, and Huns — from
  overwhelming the Empire before they can be brought under control.

  The game retains Pandemic's core loop of crisis management: players must
  race across a point-to-point map of the Roman world, managing an ever-
  growing tide of barbarian incursions while spending limited actions each
  turn. Unlike classic Pandemic, the threat here is military rather than
  epidemiological. Players recruit Roman legions, fortify cities, and engage
  barbarians in dice-based combat. Each tribe has its own color-coded cards,
  and players must collect matching sets to forge alliances — converting
  barbarians into Roman soldiers who then fight for you.

  Victory requires subduing all five tribes either through alliance or
  elimination before the Roman Empire collapses. Defeat can come from the
  loss of too many cities, the depletion of the barbarian supply (an
  overrun), or exhausting the player card deck. A solitaire mode and multiple
  difficulty levels, including the challenging "Roma Caput Mundi" variant,
  extend replayability.
