# Description
description: |
  Saint Petersburg is a card-drafting and set collection Eurogame set in the Russian city of the same name
  during the reign of Peter the Great. Designed by Michael Tummelhofer (a pseudonym representing the
  collaborative work of Bernd Brunnhofer, Jay Tummelson, and Michael Bruinsma), the game was published by
  Hans im Glück in 2004 and won both the Deutscher Spiele Preis and International Gamers Award that year.

  Each round, players draft cards from four different decks representing Craftsmen, Buildings, Aristocrats,
  and Exchange cards. Craftsmen generate rubbles (income) each round, Buildings provide victory points
  immediately or ongoing bonuses, and Aristocrats score points at game end based on sets. The clever tension
  lies in the timing: cards on the market become cheaper the longer they sit, so players must balance buying
  early for advantage versus waiting for a better price. The game ends when any deck is exhausted, rewarding
  players who build efficient engines across all three card types.
