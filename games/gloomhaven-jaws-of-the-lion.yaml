# Description
description: |
  Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion is a standalone cooperative dungeon-crawling campaign game
  set in the world of Gloomhaven, serving as both a prequel to the original game and a
  more accessible entry point into the series. Designed by Isaac Childres and published
  by Cephalofair Games in 2020, it features 25 scenarios and four new character classes:
  the Valrath Red Guard (tank and crowd control), the Inox Hatchet (ranged damage dealer),
  the Human Voidwarden (support and mind-control), and the Quatryl Demolitionist (melee
  damage and obstacle manipulation).

  Players choose two cards from their hand each round, selecting the top action of one
  card and the bottom action of the other, granting movement, attacks, heals, and special
  abilities. Randomization is handled by a shuffled attack modifier deck rather than dice,
  rewarding consistent play and deck management. Enemies activate via AI behavior decks,
  creating tactical puzzles each scenario.

  The game introduces new players gradually: the first five scenarios serve as an
  integrated tutorial, incrementally revealing rules instead of front-loading a full
  rulebook. Characters gain experience, unlock perks, and acquire items between scenarios,
  providing a satisfying sense of progression across the campaign. The four characters
  are also compatible with the original Gloomhaven game. Jaws of the Lion was initially
  released as a Target exclusive in July 2020 before a worldwide general release.
