# Description
description: |
  Brew is a dice worker-placement game set in a woodland where nature spirits
  compete to tame the four seasons and concoct powerful potions. Each player
  controls elemental dice used as workers, choosing to deploy them in forest
  regions for area-control contests or send them to the village marketplace for
  goods and upgrades. The central tension is that dice placed in forests power
  area-majority scoring, while village dice fund potion-brewing and creature
  recruitment — and potions in turn can manipulate die values to improve forest
  prospects. Woodland creatures are drafted and trained, each providing a
  persistent special ability. The interplay between the two parallel action
  systems creates interesting optimization puzzles that shift as the board
  state evolves across four rounds.
