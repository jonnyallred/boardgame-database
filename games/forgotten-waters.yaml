# Description
description: |
  Forgotten Waters is a narrative seafaring adventure game published by Plaid Hat Games
  in 2020 using the CrossroadsGame app system. Players are pirates sailing the high seas,
  each pursuing a personal story arc while collaborating to complete scenario objectives.
  The companion app serves as a dynamic narrator, delivering atmospheric prose, responding
  to player decisions, and managing monster encounters and weather events. On their turn,
  players assign crew to locations on the ship — ranging from crow's nest to cannons —
  selecting actions that determine the ship's course, manage resources, or advance the
  story. Dice rolls with colorful custom dice resolve skill checks and combat. The game
  is distinguished by its humorous writing, branching story choices, and the way personal
  character progression intertwines with collective adventure across a full campaign.
