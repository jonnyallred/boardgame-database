# Description
description: |
  A Crossroads Game of fantastical pirate adventure where players crew a ship
  together, balancing cooperative objectives with personal story arcs. An
  app provides fully voiced narration across five scenarios, guiding players
  through a humorous, branching narrative. During planning phases, players
  use worker placement to assign crew roles, then resolve skill checks with
  dice while managing ship stats like hull strength, supplies, and crew morale.
