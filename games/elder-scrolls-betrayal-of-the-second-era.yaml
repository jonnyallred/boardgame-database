# Description
description: |
  The Elder Scrolls: Betrayal of the Second Era is a cooperative adventure game for 1-4 players
  set in Tamriel during the tumultuous Second Era. War rages across the continent, cults scheme
  in the shadows, and a powerful Wood Elf aims to reshape Tamriel forever.

  Players embark on a campaign as agents from one of Tamriel's many guilds, completing quests
  across three connected sessions while journeying, battling, and delving in diverse provinces
  of a continent in conflict. Character building is central to the experience: players develop
  and advance their chosen adventurer by spending experience points, with skill lines tied to
  Stamina or Magicka stats determining what dice they roll in combat.

  The game is a strategy game of combat and character-building. Skills are the dice adventurers
  roll during battle — each skill belongs to a skill line, and each line's corresponding stat
  limits how many skill dice can be rolled per engage action. Items include multiple subtypes
  such as armor (with standard and overtax abilities triggered during engagement) and weapons
  that interact directly with skills. An intense endgame session awaits after the campaign's
  three connected sessions.

  Published by Chip Theory Games, known for high-production-value neoprene and chip-based
  components, this is their flagship licensed title bringing the beloved Elder Scrolls
  franchise to the tabletop in a rich, world-spanning campaign.
