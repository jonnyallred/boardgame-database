# Description
description: |
  The first standalone expansion for Dominion, Intrigue adds 25 new
  Kingdom cards featuring cards with multiple types and choices. Players
  must decide between different effects when playing cards, adding a
  layer of decision-making beyond the base game. Features interactive
  attack cards like Swindler, Torturer, and Saboteur, along with
  Victory cards that double as action cards, making them useful
  throughout the game rather than just dead weight.
