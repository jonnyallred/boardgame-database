# Description
description: |
  Sea Salt & Paper is a quick and gorgeous hand management and set collection card game published by
  Bombyx in 2022, designed by Bruno Cathala and Théo Rivière with striking origami-inspired artwork by
  Lucien Derainne and Pierre-Yves Gallard. The game was distributed in North America by Pandasaurus Games.

  Each turn, players either draw two cards and keep one (discarding the other face-up), or take the top
  card from one of the discard piles and activate its special ability. Maritime creatures — fish, crabs,
  squids, sailors, sharks, mermaids — form sets that score points. When a player reaches seven or more
  points, they may end the round by calling "Stop!" and scoring, or boldly declare "Last Chance!" — betting
  they will outscore all opponents before points are tallied. This press-your-luck moment creates nail-biting
  decisions. Sea Salt & Paper won the 2023 As d'Or — Jeu de l'Année (France) and earned considerable praise
  for delivering surprising strategic depth in a compact, beautifully presented package.
