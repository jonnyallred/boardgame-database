# Description
description: |
  Feed the Kraken is a social deduction game published by Spielworxx in 2022 for 5-11
  players. Players are crew members aboard a pirate ship, divided into three secret factions:
  loyal Pirates who want to reach port, Cultists who want to summon the Kraken, and the
  lone Pirate Captain who may secretly be a Cultist sympathizer. Each round, the ship's
  navigator is chosen, who then selects a helmsman to steer the ship. Vote cards determine
  the ship's direction, and majority voting resolves ties. The Cultists aim to steer the
  ship into the Kraken's territory while appearing loyal. Various role cards grant special
  abilities that help players investigate, manipulate, and deduce hidden identities.
  Betrayals, accusations, and clever misdirection define the experience, making it an
  engaging social game with strong nautical flavor.
