# Description
description: |
  1989: Dawn of Freedom is a two-player card-driven game simulating the
  revolutionary wave that swept Eastern Europe in 1989, toppling communist
  regimes across Poland, Hungary, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and
  Bulgaria. One player controls the Communist governments attempting to maintain
  power, the other the Pro-Democracy movements fighting for freedom.

  Co-designed by Jason Matthews (Twilight Struggle), the game uses the same
  card-driven engine: players choose to use a card's Ops points to place
  influence or trigger its historical event. Victory is determined by a scoring
  system that measures how much democracy has spread across each country. The
  game is renowned for its deep historical fidelity, capturing the unique
  character of each nation's revolution, and its tight, tense two-player
  dynamic. Published by GMT Games and considered a landmark in the political
  card-driven wargame genre.
