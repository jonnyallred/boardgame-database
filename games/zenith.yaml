# Description
description: |
  Zenith is a streamlined area control game set in a future solar system where
  three races — Humans, Robots, and Animods — compete for control of planets
  powered by the clean energy source Zenithium. Players place influence discs
  and advance along tech tracks to unlock abilities, racing toward one of three
  victory conditions: Absolute (3 discs on one planet), Democratic (4 discs on
  different planets), or Popular (5 discs on any planets).

  The modular board and variable tech tree paths ensure each game plays
  differently. Zenith shines as a tug-of-war at two players but scales to four.
  The game received a Kennerspiel des Jahres 2025 recognition for its elegant
  combination of accessible rules and meaningful strategic decisions.
