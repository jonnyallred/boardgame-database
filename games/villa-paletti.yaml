# Description
description: |
  Villa Paletti is a dexterity stacking game and winner of the Spiel des Jahres
  2002. Players take turns carefully removing pillars from the lower stories of
  a colorful palazzo and placing them on the highest story, slowly building a
  precarious tower. If the floor above collapses when you remove a pillar, you
  lose the round.

  The game uses color-coded scoring pillars — the thicker and rarer the pillar
  you place on top, the more points you score. The tension comes from the
  delicate physical act of removing pillars without toppling the structure, as
  the tower grows increasingly unstable with each round. A wonderfully tactile
  and accessible game for families and mixed groups.
