# Description
description: |
  Players are international investors controlling pre-WWI European powers through bond ownership. Control the nations of Austria-Hungary, Italy, France, Great Britain, Germany, and Russia by purchasing their bonds. The investor with majority control dictates each nation's actions using the innovative rondel mechanism - a wheel of options limiting repeated actions without cost. Build factories, raise armies, and deploy fleets across Europe. Success comes not from military conquest, but from strategic investment in the most successful nations. The player who best balances bond holdings in prosperous countries while manipulating their actions will accumulate the most wealth and win.
