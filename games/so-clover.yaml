# Description
description: |
  So Clover! is a cooperative word-association party game published by Repos Production in June 2021,
  designed by François Romain. The game was a 2022 Spiel des Jahres Recommended title and won the 2021
  Golden Geek Best Party Game award.

  Each player receives a clover-shaped pad divided into four sections, and places four keyword cards
  in the corners so that two keywords share each leaf. Secretly, players write one clue word on each
  leaf that connects both keywords adjacent to it. Once all players have written their clues, the pads
  are shuffled and the group works together to deduce which keywords belong to which clover, using the
  recorded clue words as guides. Teams score based on how many keywords are correctly identified across
  all players' clovers, aiming to improve their score from game to game on the Table of Legends.

  So Clover! is celebrated for being simultaneously simple, creative, and deeply satisfying. Unlike many
  word games, it plays fully cooperatively with no traitor or competitive element, making it accessible
  and welcoming for all groups. The challenge of writing a clue that bridges two potentially unrelated
  words creates wonderful "aha!" moments and playful discussion.
