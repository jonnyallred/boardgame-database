# Description
description: |
  A cooperative word-association party game where each player secretly
  writes one-word clues connecting pairs of keywords on a clover-shaped
  board. After removing the keyword cards, the team works together to
  reconstruct which words belong where using only the written clues.
  Recommended for the 2022 Spiel des Jahres.
