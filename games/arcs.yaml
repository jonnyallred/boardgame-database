# Description
description: |
  A sharp sci-fi strategy game where players are officials of a decaying
  galactic Empire vying for dominance through battle, resource gathering,
  and diplomacy. Actions are selected through an innovative trick-taking
  system where one player leads a card and others must follow suit or
  seize initiative. Battles use a risk-versus-reward dice system with
  different dice types offering varied attack profiles. Variable
  objectives drive competition across a modular star map.
