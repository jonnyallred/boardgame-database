# Description
description: |
  Falling Sky: The Gallic Revolt Against Caesar is an asymmetric wargame published by GMT
  Games in 2016, part of the COIN (Counterinsurgency) series. The game depicts Julius
  Caesar's campaigns in Gaul, with four factions — Rome, Arverni, Aedui, and Belgic tribes
  — each pursuing different and asymmetric victory conditions. Rome seeks to pacify the
  province and extract tribute; the Arverni (led by Vercingetorix) aim for Gallic unity
  and Roman defeat; the Aedui want prominence among the Gallic peoples; and the Belgic
  tribes seek to repel invaders and dominate the north. Players use a shared card deck to
  take sequenced actions: commanding troops, building fortifications, raiding, and rallying
  allies. Political and military dimensions are tightly interwoven, and the game is noted
  for its historical depth, simulation fidelity, and the elegant COIN system's ability
  to simulate complex multi-faction conflicts.
