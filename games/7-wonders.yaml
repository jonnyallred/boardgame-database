# Description
description: |
  Draft cards across three ages to build your ancient civilization and
  its Wonder of the World. Choose a card from your hand, play it
  simultaneously, then pass the rest to your neighbor. Develop commerce,
  science, military, and civic structures. Multiple paths to victory
  through set collection, military supremacy, or scientific achievements.
  Winner of the 2011 Kennerspiel des Jahres. Scales remarkably well
  from 3 to 7 players with minimal increase in play time.
