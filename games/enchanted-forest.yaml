# Description
description: |
  Enchanted Forest (known as Sagaland in Germany) is a fairy tale memory and race game
  that won the Spiel des Jahres award in 1982. Designed by Alex Randolph and Michel
  Matschoss, it has sold over 3 million copies worldwide.

  Players start in a village and race through an enchanted forest toward a castle. The
  king is seeking an heir, and the first player to correctly identify three magical
  treasures hidden beneath the forest's trees wins the crown. On each turn, players
  roll two dice and move that many spaces through the forest, moving each die's result
  separately and choosing their own path. When a player lands on a tree space, they
  secretly peek at the fairy tale symbol hidden underneath it — symbols like Cinderella's
  slipper, a magic lamp, Rumpelstiltskin's spinning wheel, and more.

  When a player reaches the castle, the king reveals which treasure he seeks. Players
  who believe they know where that treasure is hidden in the forest may announce it and
  race back to that tree to reveal it. If correct, they score a point (a turret on the
  castle); if wrong, they are sent back to the village. The winner is the first to
  correctly identify three treasures.

  The core tension of the game is pure memory: players must recall which symbols they
  peeked at and where, while also watching opponents' movements to infer what they might
  know. The roll-and-move mechanic keeps the game accessible for young players, while
  the memory element creates genuine suspense regardless of age. Originally published
  as Sagaland by Ravensburger in 1981, the game was released in English as Enchanted
  Forest the following year and remains in print today.
