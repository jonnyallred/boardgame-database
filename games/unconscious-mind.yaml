# Description
description: |
  Unconscious Mind is a euro-style board game published by Fantasia Games in 2024, set in
  the early days of Freudian psychoanalysis. Players become psychoanalysts competing for
  recognition in Sigmund Freud's inner circle, delving into clients' unconscious minds to
  bring healing and earn prestige in the city of Vienna.

  The game features an innovative multi-rondel system combined with worker placement and
  cascading effects. On each turn, players may place one or two Ideas (workers) on a
  central Meeting Table to access a variety of actions — adding tiles to their player
  board, drafting and playing cards, and moving around Vienna. The placement of Ideas also
  determines how far to advance the personal rondel's inkpot, activating a row or column
  of tile effects on the player board.

  This interplay between the shared table placement and personal rondel advancement
  creates satisfying combo chains and strategic depth. The game includes a well-designed
  solo mode and supports 1-4 players. Unconscious Mind earned praise for its thematic
  integration and the elegant tension between its multiple interconnected systems.
