# Description
description: |
  Castle Ravenloft Board Game is the first entry in the Dungeons & Dragons
  Adventure System series, a cooperative dungeon crawl for 1-5 players set
  in the gothic horror realm of Barovia. Players choose from five iconic D&D
  heroes — Dragonborn Fighter, Human Rogue, Dwarf Cleric, Eladrin Wizard,
  and Human Ranger — and work together to complete one of thirteen scenarios
  deep inside the vampire Count Strahd's cursed castle. Each turn, players
  activate their hero using power cards and dice rolls, then draw from
  encounter and monster decks that continuously spawn new threats onto the
  modular tile board. The game won the Origins Award for Best Board Game of
  2010 and the ENnie Gold Award for Best RPG Related Product, praised for
  delivering a D&D dungeon crawl experience without a Dungeon Master.
