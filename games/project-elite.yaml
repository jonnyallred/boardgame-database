# Description
description: |
  Project: ELITE is a fully cooperative real-time board game for 1-6 players in which
  a squad of elite soldiers must defend Earth against a relentless alien invasion. This
  2020 edition was co-published by CMON and Artipia Games, reimagining the 2015 original
  from Drawlab Entertainment with new content and higher production values including
  detailed miniatures.

  Each game is divided into up to eight rounds. When the timer starts, all players
  simultaneously grab their action dice and roll them furiously, spending results to move
  their characters across a modular board, attack nearby aliens with weapons, search for
  items, and complete mission objectives. Crucially, some die faces show an Alien Face
  result, which advances the enemy horde whenever a player is forced to commit it. Between
  frantic two-minute sprints, aliens spawn and march closer to their goals, ratcheting up
  the pressure with each passing round.

  The game includes five distinct missions with varied objectives — setting explosives,
  capturing aliens, gathering intelligence — and players choose from several asymmetric
  hero roles, each with unique abilities. The simultaneous real-time play creates natural
  moments of chaos and teamwork, making every session memorable. Project: ELITE strikes a
  balance between accessibility and intensity: the rules are easy to learn but the game
  demands rapid communication and quick decisions under pressure.
