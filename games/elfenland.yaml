# Description
description: |
  Elfenland is a fantasy route-building game set in the magical land of Elfenland, winner
  of the 1998 Spiel des Jahres award. Players are young elves who must complete a rite of
  passage by visiting as many of the twenty famous towns as possible in just four rounds,
  then return to their home city.

  Each round, players draw transportation cards and take turns placing transportation tokens
  (dragons, unicorns, giant pigs, troll wagons, elfcycles, magic clouds, rafts, and ferries)
  on the roads between cities. Different terrain types require different modes of transport,
  and each transportation type costs a specific set of matching cards to use. Crucially, once
  a token is placed on a road segment, all players may use it — so clever placement can help
  you while also benefiting rivals.

  The tension lies in hand management: players must plan efficient routes across the map
  while dealing with the cards available to them and the transport tokens others place. The
  player who visits the most towns wins; ties are broken by cards remaining in hand.

  Originally based on Moon's earlier four-hour game Elfenroads (White Wind, 1992), Elfenland
  streamlines the experience into an accessible, beautifully illustrated family game. An
  expansion, Elfengold, adds economic and bidding elements.
