# Description
description: |
  Forbidden Desert is a cooperative survival game designed by Matt Leacock and published
  by Gamewright in 2013. Players are a team of adventurers stranded in a shifting desert
  after their aircraft crashes, racing to uncover the parts of an ancient flying machine
  before dying of thirst or being buried by a relentless sandstorm. The desert is made
  of 24 tiles that shift with the wind, continuously burying tiles under sand markers.
  Players have a shared water supply that drains as the storm rages and as players move
  across the desert. Each character has a special role with unique abilities. Players must
  excavate tiles to discover the four machine parts, managing water, sand levels, and
  the storm track simultaneously. Forbidden Desert builds on Forbidden Island's formula
  with a more challenging experience and clever tile-flip mechanics for locating parts.
