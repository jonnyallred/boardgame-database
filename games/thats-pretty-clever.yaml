# Description
description: |
  Choose your dice cleverly in this roll-and-write classic. On your turn,
  roll six colored dice and pick three to mark off numbers in matching
  colored areas on your score sheet. Chain together bonuses across
  different sections for satisfying combo plays. Dice you don't use go
  on a silver platter for opponents to choose from, keeping everyone
  engaged even on other players' turns. Originally published as
  "Ganz schon clever" in German. Nominated for the 2018 Kennerspiel
  des Jahres.
