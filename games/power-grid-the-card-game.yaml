# Description
description: |
  Power Grid: The Card Game is a streamlined card game adaptation of the popular
  Power Grid board game, designed by Friedemann Friese and published by Rio Grande
  Games in 2016. Players take on the roles of CEOs of power companies competing to
  produce the most electricity by the end of the game.

  The game captures the core tension and tactics of its board game predecessors
  (Power Grid Recharged and Power Grid Deluxe) without requiring the large map
  boards. Players bid in auctions to acquire power plant cards, then purchase
  resource cards — coal, oil, garbage, uranium, or renewables — to fuel their
  plants and generate electricity. Turn order is carefully managed, as leading
  players go last in auctions but first in resource purchasing, creating a constant
  push-pull dynamic.

  Gameplay proceeds through a series of rounds in which a row of power plants is
  available for auction. After acquiring plants, players stock up on resources and
  tally their power output. The market depletes as the game progresses, ramping up
  tension as high-value plants and scarce resources become contested. The player
  who generates the most electricity when the deck runs out wins.

  The card game format compresses a full Power Grid experience into roughly 60
  minutes while preserving the economic decision-making and interactive resource
  competition that fans of the original enjoy.
