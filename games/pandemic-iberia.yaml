# Description
description: |
  Set on the Iberian Peninsula in 1848, players take on roles such as nurse,
  railwayman, rural doctor, and sailor to research and combat malaria, typhus,
  yellow fever, and cholera. Unlike base Pandemic, diseases can only be
  researched rather than cured, players build railway networks for faster
  travel, and purified water tokens help slow the spread of disease. Scalable
  difficulty from Introductory to Heroic via epidemic card count.
