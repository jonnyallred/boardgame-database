description: |
  Doodle Dungeon is a draft-and-draw dungeon design game where players take on the roles of
  Dungeon Masters creating their own dungeons to confound an adventuring hero. Players draft
  cards to draw dungeon elements — rooms, corridors, traps, monsters, and treasures — onto
  their personal dungeon blueprints. Once construction is complete, players send their hero into
  opponents' dungeons, tracing a path through the dungeon to try to reach the treasure. The
  dungeon with the most effective layout — making it hard for heroes to succeed while still
  earning treasure placement bonuses — wins. The reverse-dungeon-crawl concept, combined with
  John Kovalic's charming artwork (Munchkin fame), creates an accessible and entertaining
  alternative to traditional dungeon crawlers.
