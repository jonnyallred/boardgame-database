# Description
description: |
  Deus is a civilization-building game set in antiquity published by Pearl Games in 2014.
  Players compete to build civilizations across a shared modular map by placing buildings
  of five types — military, maritime, civic, scientific, and production — on territory
  tiles. Each building placed triggers a card-play mechanic: players choose a card from
  their hand matching the building's color, activating that card's ability and also
  triggering all previously played cards of the same color in order. This chain-reaction
  combo system creates powerful engine-building opportunities. Players can also sacrifice
  cards to gain resources and pray to gods for special powers. Victory points come from
  territorial control, building chains, and completed objectives. The variable map setup
  and card-combo depth make each game feel fresh and strategically rich.
