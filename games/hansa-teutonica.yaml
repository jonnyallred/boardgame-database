# Description
description: |
  Hansa Teutonica is a midweight Euro strategy game set in the medieval trading network
  of the Hanseatic League — the powerful merchant alliance that dominated Northern
  European commerce from the 13th to 17th centuries. Players compete to establish
  trading posts across a map of German and Baltic cities by placing traders (cubes)
  and merchants (discs) on the routes connecting them.

  On their turn, players take two actions (expandable through upgrades): placing tokens
  on roads, moving tokens already on the board, displacing rival tokens by bumping them
  off routes, or claiming completed routes to found new offices in cities. Cities grant
  powerful bonuses — extra actions, more traders, greater movement — and improving these
  skills is central to the game's engine-building feel.

  Victory points flow from multiple sources: controlling entire trade routes, establishing
  offices in key cities, collecting bonus markers on roads, and having other players pass
  through cities where you hold an office. This multiplicity of scoring paths creates
  constant tension, as players must balance their own development against blocking
  opponents' most profitable connections.

  The game won the 2010 International Gamers Award and is widely regarded as a classic
  of the network-building genre. A Big Box edition published by Z-Man Games in 2020
  includes the base game plus the Britannia and East map expansions.
