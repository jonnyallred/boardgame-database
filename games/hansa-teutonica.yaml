# Description
description: |
  Compete as merchants building trade networks across the Hanseatic League.
  Place traders on routes between cities, complete connections to establish
  offices, and upgrade your abilities to take more actions, move further,
  or collect more points. Displacement of opponents' traders creates
  constant interaction and tension. Deceptively simple rules with deep
  strategic paths. Winner of the 2010 Deutscher Spiele Preis top 3.
