# Description
description: |
  A solo horror board game inspired by slasher films. Play as the Final
  Girl, the last survivor who must face and defeat the killer. Each game
  pairs a Core Box with a Feature Film Box containing a unique killer,
  location, and terror cards. Roll dice, manage your hand of action cards,
  search for items, rescue victims, and set up the final showdown. The
  modular system allows mixing and matching killers, locations, and
  final girls across all feature film sets.
