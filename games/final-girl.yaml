# Description
description: |
  A solo horror survival game where you play the Final Girl trying to defeat
  a supernatural killer before all other victims are eliminated. Each game
  combines one killer box with one location box, creating unique scenarios from
  a slasher movie universe. Manage your hand of action cards, roll dice to fight
  or flee, and find items to gain an edge. The killer activates each round from
  a dedicated deck, escalating tension toward a deadly final confrontation.
