# Description
description: |
  Cubitos is a dice-building racing game in which players take on the role of competitors
  in the annual Cube Cup. Each player has a runner on the racetrack and a pool of dice
  representing their support team. On each turn, players simultaneously roll their dice,
  moving successful results to an Active Zone, and deciding whether to press their luck
  and keep rolling or bank their results.

  Players start with nine dice — seven light grey cubes showing money and two dark grey
  cubes showing money and movement points (feet). Credits earned from money faces allow
  players to purchase new dice from a shared market of eight different colored dice types,
  each with seven possible ability cards. This creates enormous variability across games.
  Upgraded dice grant special powers such as swapping out dice from reserve, generating
  bonus movement, or even interfering with opponents.

  Movement feet on dice advance a player's runner around one of four different racetrack
  maps, and the first player to cross the finish line wins. The simultaneous rolling
  mechanism keeps everyone engaged throughout, while the press-your-luck element — if you
  roll only blank faces (busted), you lose all unbanked results — creates constant tension.
  The modular dice card system ensures high replayability with a huge variety of possible
  ability combinations each game.
