# Description
description: |
  Alchemists is a worker placement game with a unique deduction twist: players are
  competing alchemists trying to discover the secret properties of eight ingredients
  and publish theories about them before their rivals. The catch is that the true
  alchemical properties are hidden — players must deduce them through experimentation.

  The game uses a companion app (or a dedicated code wheel in earlier editions) to
  adjudicate experiment results privately. When you mix two ingredients, the app
  tells you what potion results, and from these clues you deduce which ingredient
  has which alchemical signature. Publishing a theory earns points, but publishing
  a wrong theory earns debunking penalties.

  The worker placement system governs access to experiments, markets, and publishing
  opportunities, while the deduction layer requires careful logical reasoning across
  the game's six rounds. Alchemists rewards systematic thinking and bluffs, and is
  notable as one of the first major games to use a smartphone app as an integral
  gameplay component.
