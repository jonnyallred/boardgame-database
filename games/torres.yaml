# Description
description: |
  Torres is an award-winning abstract strategy game designed by Wolfgang Kramer and
  Michael Kiesling, originally published by F.X. Schmid in 1999 with an English edition
  from Rio Grande Games. It won the Spiel des Jahres that year alongside a second-place
  finish at the Deutscher Spiele Preis.

  Players are medieval knights building and competing to occupy the highest levels of
  growing castles. The three-dimensional board evolves as players spend their five action
  points each turn to expand castle footprints, stack additional castle blocks upward, or
  move knights between towers. Only one knight can occupy the highest level of any castle
  at scoring time, so control of the tallest positions is fiercely contested.

  The joy of Torres lies in the tactical efficiency of those five action points — choosing
  when to build, when to climb, and when to block opponents. A hand of action cards
  provides additional special abilities each round. Clean rules mask surprisingly deep
  positional play that has made this Kiesling-Kramer collaboration a lasting classic.
