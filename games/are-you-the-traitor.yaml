# Description
description: |
  A secret-role deception game for 4-10 players set in a whimsical fantasy world
  where a magical Key must reach the Good Wizard before the Evil Wizard can claim
  it. Each player is dealt a role card — Key-Holder, Guard, Traitor, or Wizard —
  and a second alignment card secretly determines whether the Wizard is Good or
  Evil. Free-form discussion and social pressure drive each round until someone
  makes an accusation: Guards try to catch the Traitor, the Key-Holder races to
  find the Good Wizard, and the Evil Wizard seeks to identify the Key-Holder.
  Winning team members collect Treasure cards worth 0-5 points, and the first
  player to accumulate 10 points wins the game.
