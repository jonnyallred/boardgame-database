# Description
description: |
  A fully cooperative campaign game set in the League of Legends universe, where
  2-4 players pilot customized mechs through 10 escalating missions against waves
  of minions. Each player programs their mech by slotting command cards into a
  six-space queue that executes in order each round, requiring careful coordination
  to avoid friendly fire and achieve mission objectives. Missions are self-contained
  but form a connected narrative. Widely praised for exceptional production quality —
  100 minion miniatures, four detailed mech figures — at a surprisingly accessible
  price point.
