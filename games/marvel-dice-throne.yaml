# Description
description: |
  Marvel Dice Throne is a fast-playing dice and card dueling game in which each
  player takes the role of one of eight Marvel heroes — Black Panther, Captain
  Marvel, Black Widow, Scarlet Witch, Loki, Thor, Doctor Strange, or Miles
  Morales Spider-Man — each with a unique set of five custom dice and a
  dedicated deck of ability cards.

  Often described as "Yahtzee meets Magic: The Gathering," players take turns
  rolling and re-rolling their hero's dice, trying to hit specific combinations
  that trigger attacks and special abilities. Combat points earned each round
  can be spent on cards that grant permanent hero upgrades, apply status effects
  to opponents, or manipulate dice results, providing meaningful decisions that
  layer atop the luck of the roll.

  The game supports multiple formats: 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 2v2v2, or free-for-all,
  with each hero box sold separately or in multi-hero sets. Because each hero
  plays completely differently, the game rewards learning the distinct rhythm of
  your chosen character while adapting to your opponent's capabilities.
