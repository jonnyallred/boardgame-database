# Description
description: |
  A cooperative boss-battling campaign set in a dark fantasy world called
  the Deepwood. Players take on the roles of Oathsworn, heroes sworn to
  protect the last free city from monstrous threats. Each session combines
  narrative choices through a branching storybook with tactical miniature
  combat encounters against massive boss creatures. Features a unique
  Battleflow card system for hand management, exploding dice for push-your-luck
  combat, and a deep 21-chapter legacy campaign with leveling, loot, and
  story consequences.
