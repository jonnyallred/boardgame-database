# Description
description: |
  Narrative dungeon crawler following a company of mercenaries in a dark
  fantasy world. Each session blends story chapters—read aloud with branching
  choices—with tactical boss battles featuring massive standee miniatures.
  Enemies use behavior decks for unpredictable combat. Between missions, develop
  your camp, craft weapons, and level up characters with interconnected ability
  trees. A deeply written world with meaningful choices that carry across the
  campaign. One of the most ambitious narrative dungeon crawlers ever made.
