# Description
description: |
  Kelp: Shark vs Octopus is a strictly 2-player asymmetric game set in a South African
  kelp forest, inspired by the Netflix documentary "My Octopus Teacher." One player
  controls the Pyjama Shark and the other plays as the Common Octopus, each with
  completely different mechanics, components, and win conditions.

  The Octopus player uses a deck-building system, playing cards to sneak around the
  board while managing hidden and revealed position tokens — channeling the creature's
  remarkable camouflage and deception abilities. The Octopus wins by either surviving
  until the Shark exhausts all 7 of its dice, or by collecting and consuming all four
  seafood tiles.

  The Shark player rolls dice to patrol the kelp forest and hunt down the elusive
  Octopus, using special abilities to mitigate luck and narrow the search. The Shark
  wins by successfully attacking the Octopus before its dice pool runs out.

  The sharp asymmetry in both components and strategy creates a tense hide-and-seek
  dynamic where each player must think entirely differently. The game blends deck
  building, bag building, hidden movement, bluffing, and deduction into a compact
  40-60 minute head-to-head experience.
