# Description
description: |
  Sneak aboard Lord Eradikus' flagship to steal valuable artifacts and
  escape before getting caught. Build your deck to move through the modular
  spaceship, hack terminals, fight enemies, and acquire powerful new cards.
  Every noisy action adds clank cubes to the bag, risking damage when
  Eradikus attacks. Push deeper for better loot but risk not making it to
  an escape pod in time. A sci-fi reimplementation of Clank! with added
  mechanics like faction-based card synergies and hacking.
