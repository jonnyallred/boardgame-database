# Description
description: |
  The legendary island of Atlantis is sinking! An underwater volcano has erupted and
  players must race to evacuate their people to the safety of nearby islands before
  the island disappears beneath the waves. On each turn, players move their meeples
  across the modular board of randomly-placed land tiles, either walking on land,
  swimming in the ocean, or riding in boats. After movement, they must remove one
  land tile from the board, sinking that piece of Atlantis forever. Finally, they
  roll a creature die to move sharks, whales, or sea serpents to attack opponents.
  Sharks eat swimmers, whales capsize boats, and sea serpents destroy boats and
  devour all passengers. Each meeple has a hidden point value on the bottom, adding
  a memory element as players try to remember which pieces are most valuable. The
  player who successfully evacuates the most points worth of meeples wins this
  cutthroat survival game.
