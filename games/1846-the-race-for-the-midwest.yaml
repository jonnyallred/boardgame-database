# Description
description: |
  In 1846, players act as tycoons competing to build the best stock portfolio by
  investing in and operating railroads across the midwestern United States during
  the rail expansion era of 1846-1935. Play proceeds through stock rounds where
  players buy and sell shares, followed by operating rounds where corporations lay
  track, build stations, run trains for revenue, and upgrade equipment. The game
  features an opening draft of private companies, variable setup that scales with
  player count, and streamlined mechanics that make it one of the more accessible
  18xx games while maintaining deep strategic decision-making.
