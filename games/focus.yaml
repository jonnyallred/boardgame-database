# Description
description: |
  Focus (also known as Domination or Dominio) is an abstract strategy board game designed
  by Sid Sackson and first published by Kosmos in 1964. It won the Spiel des Jahres in 1981
  and the Essen Feather award that same year, bringing it widespread recognition in Germany.
  The game was later reprinted by Milton Bradley under the name Domination in 1982.

  Players move stacks of pieces on a distinctive board — a checkerboard with the three corner
  squares removed from each corner, forming a cross-like shape. A stack may move a number of
  spaces equal to the number of pieces in it. Players may only move a stack topped by one of
  their own pieces. When stacks merge and exceed five pieces, pieces are removed from the bottom:
  a player's own removed pieces are held in reserve and may be re-entered onto the board on a
  future turn, while opponents' removed pieces are captured permanently. The last player able to
  move wins.

  The game rewards deep tactical thinking: controlling stacks, building tall towers for greater
  mobility, and managing your reserve pieces. It was first featured in Martin Gardner's
  Mathematical Games column in Scientific American in October 1963, and later included in
  Sackson's landmark compendium A Gamut of Games.
