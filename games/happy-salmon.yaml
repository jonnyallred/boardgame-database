# Description
description: |
  Happy Salmon is an ultra-fast, chaotic real-time card game where everyone
  plays simultaneously — there are no turns. Each player holds a deck of cards,
  each showing one of four actions: High Five, Pound It (fist bump), Switcheroo
  (swap places), or Happy Salmon (a forearm-to-forearm fish-flopping gesture).
  On the count of three, all players flip their decks face up and immediately
  start shouting out their top card's action, frantically searching for a
  partner doing the same action. When two players match, they perform the
  action together and both discard that card, revealing the next. The first
  player to discard their entire hand wins.

  A full game lasts under two minutes, making it an ideal icebreaker or
  between-game palate cleanser. Originally published by North Star Games in
  2016, it was later acquired and republished by Exploding Kittens with an
  expanded player count of up to 8. The game was designed by Ken Gruhl and
  Quentin Weir and has become a staple party game for all ages.
