# Description
description: |
  Unmatched Adventures: Tales to Amaze brings cooperative play to the acclaimed
  Unmatched combat system. One to four heroes band together to stop powerful
  villains — such as the Alien Invader or the terrifying Mothman — and their
  minions threatening the world. The four included heroes are Nikola Tesla,
  Annie Christmas, the Golden Bat, and Dr. Jill Trent the Science Sleuth, each
  with unique decks and abilities.

  On each turn, players play cards from their hand to move, attack, and use
  special powers, coordinating their efforts to whittle down the villain before
  they are overwhelmed. Heroes and their card decks can be freely mixed and
  matched with other Unmatched sets. The game also supports standard competitive
  Unmatched play using the included heroes.
