# Description
description: |
  Codenames: Duet is a fully cooperative word deduction game designed primarily for two
  players, spun off from the hit party game Codenames. Players work together as a pair
  of secret agents trying to identify all 15 of their contacts hidden among 25 word cards
  laid out in a 5x5 grid — without stumbling into any assassins.

  The core twist is asymmetric information: each player holds one side of a double-sided
  key card, so neither player can see the complete picture. Three of each player's nine
  green agent squares overlap with the other player's, meaning some words are safe for
  both sides and some are agents for one player but bystanders (or assassins) for the
  other. Players alternate giving one-word clues linked to a number, guiding their partner
  to tap the correct words. An incorrect guess on an assassin ends the game immediately
  in defeat.

  The game is played over a limited number of turns (9 by default, extendable to 11 for
  beginners), creating a tight time pressure that demands concise, creative cluing. A
  campaign mode with missions of increasing difficulty adds long-term replay value. The
  game can also be played cooperatively in larger groups split into two teams.

  Codenames: Duet won the 2018 Origins Award for Best Family Game and is widely praised
  as one of the best two-player cooperative games for couples and casual gamers.
