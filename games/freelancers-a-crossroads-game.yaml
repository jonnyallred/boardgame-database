# Description
description: |
  Freelancers: A Crossroads Game condenses the fantasy RPG campaign experience into a
  single night of fun and mayhem. Set in a post-human world where a broken gig economy
  has left adventurers scrambling for work, players create freelancers by mixing and
  matching species and job combinations, then venture into ruins, brave the wilds, and
  slay hideous creatures in pursuit of loot.

  The game is fully app-assisted — a companion app handles all the storytelling with
  fully-voiced, branching narrative, eliminating the need for a game master. Five
  replayable campaigns each cram the full arc of an RPG session into one sitting.
  Players gain experience, skills, gold, and followers as they make choices along
  hundreds of branching story paths.

  Mechanically, characters grow by making decisions that unlock new skills tied to
  bigger and better dice, increasing the chance of succeeding skill checks. The game
  won Best Thematic Game of 2023 and is the third entry in Plaid Hat Games' Crossroads
  series, following Forgotten Waters and Dead of Winter.
