# Description
description: |
  Set in 1962 at the height of the Cold War, players take on the roles of
  newly recruited CIA agents tasked with investigating and dismantling a
  Soviet bioweapon program known as Project MEDUSA. Unlike earlier Pandemic
  games, players use aliases and covert identities to infiltrate enemy
  cities, neutralize Soviet agents, and complete espionage missions. As
  the campaign unfolds across 12+ sessions, decisions permanently alter
  the game world, revealing new rules, components, and narrative twists.
