# Description
description: |
  Cold War prequel set in 1962, before the events of Pandemic Legacy: Season 1.
  Players are CIA operatives working to prevent Soviet bioweapon deployment.
  Build a network of aliases and safe houses, gather intel, and complete covert
  missions across 12 months of campaign play. Disguise mechanics let characters
  assume different identities across cities. Maintains Pandemic's card-driven
  tension while adding spy thriller flavor and legacy consequences that
  permanently alter the world map and operative roster.
