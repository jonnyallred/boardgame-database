# Description
description: |
  Build an interstellar civilization through exploration, research,
  conquest, and diplomacy. A streamlined 4X game where players expand
  into a modular hex galaxy, research technologies on a shared tech
  tree, customize spaceships with upgradeable blueprints, and battle
  for territory using dice combat. An elegant action selection and
  economic system forces tough decisions about expansion versus
  sustainability. Winner of the 2012 International Gamers Award.
