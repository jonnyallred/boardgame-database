description: |
  Dungeons & Dragons: The Fantasy Adventure Board Game is a dungeon-crawl game published by
  Parker Brothers (Hasbro) in 2003 based on the classic roleplaying game. Players choose from
  pre-generated hero characters and work through quests presented in a scenario booklet, exploring
  dungeon rooms, fighting monsters, and collecting treasure. The game uses custom dice including
  attack, trap detection, and special dice to resolve encounters. While sharing a dungeon-crawl
  format with HeroQuest (and borrowing some of its mechanics), the game adds flexibility with
  an empty map framework allowing players to create custom layouts. Published primarily for the
  European market, it offers an accessible introduction to D&D dungeon-crawling concepts without
  requiring a Dungeon Master.
