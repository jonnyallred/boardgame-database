description: |
  Elasund: The First City is the second game in Klaus Teuber's Catan Adventures series, depicting
  the history of the island of Catan before Settlers arrives. Players build the first city of
  Elasund by placing building tiles on a city grid, competing for valuable locations. A Settlers
  of Catan-style resource roll at the start of each turn produces goods from established buildings,
  and a "7" roll triggers negative effects. Resources are spent constructing various buildings —
  homes, churches, guildhalls, and windmills — each contributing different point values or
  powers. Like Settlers, control of the longest road and largest church equivalents grants
  bonus points. While sharing Catan DNA, Elasund features tile-placement city-building
  distinctly its own, rewarding aggressive construction and positioning over pure trading.
