# Description
description: |
  Set in an alternate 19th-century Saxony where nuclear power was discovered
  early, players take on the role of industrialists competing during an
  economic and technological boom. Build networks of railways and power
  lines, construct and power urban buildings, secure contracts, and unlock
  asymmetric technologies. Uses dual-purpose action tiles for network
  connections and actions with no rounds or phases—play is continuous.
