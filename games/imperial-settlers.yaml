# Description
description: |
  Lead one of four unique factions—Romans, Barbarians, Egyptians, or Japanese—
  to build a mighty empire across five rounds. Draft location cards, construct
  buildings, harvest resources, and attack neighboring settlements. Each faction
  has distinct strengths and playstyles, with multi-use cards offering tactical
  choices. A reimplementation of 51st State with a civilization-building theme
  and streamlined mechanics for more accessible engine-building gameplay.
