# Description
description: |
  The Lord of the Rings: Duel for Middle-earth is a two-player card-driven game in which
  one player embodies the Fellowship of the Ring, seeking to protect the free peoples and
  destroy the One Ring, while the other plays as Sauron, attempting to capture Frodo and
  Sam and overwhelm Middle-earth with his evil hordes.

  Designed by Antoine Bauza and Bruno Cathala and illustrated by Vincent Dutrait, the game
  draws spiritual inspiration from 7 Wonders Duel, adapting its competitive card-tableau
  structure to Tolkien's lore. A game unfolds over three successive chapters. On each turn,
  players strengthen Skills by building chapter cards, advance on the Quest of the Ring
  track, rally Races of Middle-earth as allies, place Units in regions across the map, or
  execute special Maneuvers.

  There are three paths to victory: completing the Quest of the Ring (destroying or seizing
  the One Ring at Mount Doom), sealing alliances with six Races of Middle-earth, or
  dominating Middle-earth through military presence. The asymmetric factions give each side
  distinct objectives and card types, ensuring the two roles feel meaningfully different.
  Vincent Dutrait's painting-style artwork immerses players in Tolkien's world throughout.
