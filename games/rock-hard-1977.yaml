# Description
description: |
  Rock Hard: 1977 is a worker placement game designed by Jackie Fox, the former
  bassist of the legendary rock band The Runaways. Players take on the roles of
  aspiring rock stars in 1977 America, racing to accumulate the most Fame points
  before the year ends. The game unfolds over 9 rounds, each representing a month
  from April through December 1977.

  Each player manages a personal player board styled like a guitar amplifier,
  featuring dials tracking three key stats — Chops, Songs, and Reputation —
  all of which go up to 11. Through worker placement actions, players pursue
  gigs, record deals, and music industry connections to boost their Fame.

  A distinctive "candy" mechanic adds press-your-luck tension: taking a candy
  card grants an immediate bonus action ("sugar rush"), but raises a Cravings
  dial. If a die roll exceeds the Cravings level, the player crashes and must
  spend their next turn recovering, missing a day's action. This risk-reward
  system captures the excess and unpredictability of the 70s rock lifestyle.

  Rock Hard: 1977 was a breakout hit at Gen Con 2024 — selling out on its first
  day — and was named one of Smithsonian Magazine's best board games of 2024.
  The game draws heavily on Fox's own experiences in the music industry, blending
  authentic thematic flavour with tight Euro-style decision making.
