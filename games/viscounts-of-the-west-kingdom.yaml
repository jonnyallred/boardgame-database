# Description
description: |
  The final installment in the West Kingdom trilogy, set in the early
  centuries of the second millennium. Players take on the roles of
  viscounts, traveling around the kingdom seeking upgrades and
  competing for influence. Move your viscount around a rondel-style
  board, building structures, writing manuscripts, working in the
  castle, and acquiring deeds for new land. Features deck building
  with townsfolk cards that determine your available actions and
  abilities. The game ends when the kingdom reaches a threshold of
  poverty or prosperity, and the player with the most victory points
  wins.
