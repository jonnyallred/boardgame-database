# Description
description: |
  Players trace the legendary routes of the Silk Road in just five rounds, rolling
  their dice pools at the start of each turn and assigning them to city locations
  on the map to gather resources, complete contracts, and travel across Asia. Each
  player controls a unique character with a powerful asymmetric ability that shapes
  their entire strategy. Collecting goods, fulfilling contracts, and reaching key
  cities like Beijing all contribute to victory points. The tight five-round structure
  creates intense, compressed decision-making with high replayability.
