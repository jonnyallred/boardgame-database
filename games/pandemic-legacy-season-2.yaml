# Description
description: |
  Set 71 years after the collapse depicted in Season 1, humanity has retreated
  to isolated haven cities surviving on supply drops. Players work together to
  rediscover the lost world, establish supply lines, and find a cure for
  the remaining diseases. Like its predecessor, every game permanently alters
  the board, unlocks new content, and carries consequences forward. A more
  narrative and exploration-focused campaign than Season 1.
