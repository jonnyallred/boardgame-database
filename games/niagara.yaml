# Description
description: |
  Niagara is a German-style family game set on the river above the famous waterfall.
  Players paddle their canoes up and down the river collecting coloured gems and racing
  them back to shore before being swept over the falls. The board features an innovative
  three-dimensional waterfall built into the game box — a hinged flap hangs over the box
  edge to represent the drop — and the river is simulated by clear plastic discs that
  slide along a grooved surface, flowing downstream each round.

  Each turn, players simultaneously choose a paddle tile from their hand (numbered 1-5)
  to move their canoes. After all paddles are revealed, the river currents are calculated:
  the sum of all paddles played determines how many disc spaces the river advances toward
  the waterfall. Playing high-numbered paddles lets you move more spaces but also pushes
  the river faster, threatening every canoe on the water. Gems rest on the river discs
  and drift along with them, while canoes that go over the falls lose their cargo.

  Players can collect gems from river spaces and carry them back to shore, or steal gems
  directly from rivals' canoes. Victory goes to the first player to bring ashore four
  gems of the same colour, one gem of each of the five colours, or seven gems in total.
  The constant tension between moving efficiently and controlling the river speed — since
  every paddle you play affects the whole table — gives the game its signature nail-biting
  quality. Winner of the 2005 Spiel des Jahres.
