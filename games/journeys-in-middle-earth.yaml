# Description
description: |
  The Lord of the Rings: Journeys in Middle-Earth is a fully cooperative, app-supported
  dungeon-crawl style adventure game for 1-5 players set in Tolkien's beloved world. Players
  choose iconic heroes such as Bilbo, Aragorn, Legolas, or Gimli, each with unique skill decks
  that replace dice rolls entirely — cards drawn from your personal deck determine success and
  failure on skill tests. The companion app controls enemy behavior, tracks campaign progress,
  generates the story, and reveals new map tiles as players explore. Each hero has a role (Guardian,
  Burglar, Pathfinder, etc.) shaping their deck-building options over the campaign. Between
  sessions, heroes level up and customize their skill decks, creating a persistent narrative
  arc across a multi-scenario campaign. The game delivers the scope and feel of a grand
  Middle-Earth adventure with manageable complexity and excellent solo play.
