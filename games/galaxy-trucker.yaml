# Description
description: |
  Galaxy Trucker is a chaotic, fast-paced science fiction game in which players
  simultaneously build their own spaceships by grabbing component tiles from a
  central warehouse in real time — using only one hand at a time. Players race
  to construct their ships before a timer expires, snapping together engines,
  guns, crew quarters, cargo holds, and shields in any configuration they choose.

  Once building ends, players embark on a shared journey through space, flipping
  adventure cards that reveal pirates, meteor showers, abandoned vessels, smugglers,
  and lucrative cargo opportunities. Ships that were poorly built fall apart under
  fire or lose components to cosmic hazards, while well-constructed vessels sail
  through and claim riches. The goal is to end the game with the most credits,
  earned by delivering cargo, winning battles, arriving first, and simply surviving
  in better shape than your rivals.

  The Second Edition (2021) consolidates the original 2007 game with content from
  the Anniversary Edition expansion, adding new tiles, a revised rulebook, and
  refreshed graphic design while keeping the beloved frantic building phase and
  gleefully punishing adventure sequence intact. Galaxy Trucker is widely celebrated
  for its humor, accessible real-time mechanics, and the schadenfreude of watching
  carefully built ships get obliterated.
