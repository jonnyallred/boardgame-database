# Description
description: |
  Too Many Bones is a critically acclaimed dice-builder RPG published by Chip Theory Games
  in 2017, designed by brothers Josh and Adam Carlson. Players assemble a party of
  Gearlocs — unique characters each with 21 custom dice representing their skills and
  abilities — and journey to face the fierce Tyrants of Ebonheart.

  Combat takes place on a 4x4 Battle Mat where Gearlocs and Baddies move, attack, and
  defend in tactical skirmish encounters. The game features a cooperative experience where
  players explore dozens of skills and hundreds of dice combinations as their adventure
  moves between encounters and battles.

  Known for its exceptional component quality, Too Many Bones features 136 custom dice,
  edge-stitched neoprene mats, PVC cards, and high-quality chips — all manufactured by
  Chip Theory Games directly. Each Gearloc has completely unique gameplay mechanics,
  providing deep asymmetry and high replayability. The game rewards multiple plays as
  players learn to build optimal skill combinations against ever-changing Tyrant encounters.
