# Description
description: |
  It's a Wonderful World is a card drafting and engine building game for 1-5 players
  in which each player leads a rapidly expanding Empire competing to generate the most
  victory points over 4 rounds.

  Each round, players receive a hand of 7 Development cards and draft them one at a
  time, passing the remainder to a neighbor (direction alternates each round). After
  drafting, each player decides which cards to recycle immediately for a bonus resource
  and which to place in their construction area. Cards in the construction area must be
  completed by accumulating the required resources across production phases before they
  can score. Completed cards add to a player's ongoing resource engine — producing
  Materials, Energy, Science, Gold, or Exploration tokens each round — or grant
  end-game victory points.

  The tension in every draft pick comes from choosing between cards that feed your
  current engine strategy, cards that could be quickly recycled for needed resources,
  and cards that would be helpful to your opponents. Over four tightly paced rounds,
  players race to complete ambitious projects and outproduce their rivals.

  The game won the Tric Trac d'Or 2019 and received a nomination for the As d'Or Expert
  in January 2020. It plays well solo and shines most at 3-5 players; the solo mode
  uses a simulated drafting mechanism to preserve the full experience.
