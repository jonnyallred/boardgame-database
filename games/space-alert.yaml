# Description
description: |
  A cooperative real-time survival game where players act as spaceship crew members
  protecting their vessel during chaotic 10-minute missions. A soundtrack announces
  various threats while players frantically coordinate defensive actions using programmed
  movement cards. After the frenzied real-time phase, the team resolves their queued
  actions to discover whether their hasty planning saved the ship or led to disaster.
  Winner of multiple innovation awards including the 2009 Spiel des Jahres Special Prize.
