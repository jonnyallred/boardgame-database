description: |
  Dino World is a fast-playing flicking card game published by HABA for the whole family.
  Players flick dinosaur cards from the edge of the game box toward other dinosaur cards spread
  on the table. Color-coded edges determine which cards qualify as prey — when you hit a valid
  prey card, you collect it and place it beneath your wooden dinosaur marker. The game uses
  52 dinosaur cards in five different sizes representing various prehistoric creatures. The
  dexterity element of flicking cards with precision makes each turn exciting, as even a strong
  prehistoric predator can miss its mark. Simple enough for young children yet entertaining
  enough for adults, Dino World is a prehistoric hunting game that fits in a tiny box.
