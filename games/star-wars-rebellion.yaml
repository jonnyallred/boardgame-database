# Description
description: |
  Star Wars: Rebellion is a grand asymmetric 2-4 player wargame depicting the Galactic Civil
  War between the Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance. One to two players control the massive
  resources of the Empire, seeking to crush the Rebellion by subjugating planets and hunting
  down the hidden Rebel base. The other side commands the scrappy Rebels, using guerrilla tactics,
  diplomatic missions, and sabotage to build sympathy and survive until public support swings their
  way. The game features hidden movement (the Rebel base remains secret), leader deployment for
  missions across a sprawling 32-planet board, and cinematic combat using custom dice. With over
  150 plastic miniatures including Star Destroyers, AT-ATs, and X-Wings, the game delivers an
  epic scope that captures the feel of the original Star Wars trilogy.
