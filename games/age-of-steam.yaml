# Description
description: |
  Age of Steam is Martin Wallace's landmark railroad game in which players
  compete to build the most profitable rail network across the industrial
  American heartland. Each round players must first issue shares to raise
  capital and then bid aggressively for turn order and special action
  privileges, creating relentless financial pressure from the very first
  move. Players lay track tiles, upgrade their locomotives, and deliver
  color-coded goods cubes to matching cities, earning income that advances
  them along a tight income track. Victory points are tallied at game end
  from income steps gained, completed railroad links, minus penalties for
  shares issued — rewarding efficient networks over reckless expansion.
  Famously cutthroat and unforgiving, Age of Steam won the 2003
  International Gamers Award and spawned over two hundred expansion maps
  covering locations worldwide.
