# Description
description: |
  Build railroad networks and deliver goods across the American Rust Belt
  in this cutthroat economic train game. Players auction for turn order
  and special actions, issue shares to raise capital (at the cost of
  future income), lay track to connect cities, and deliver goods to
  earn revenue. Cash management is brutal - overspend and you spiral
  into debt. One of the definitive heavy train games with over 100
  expansion maps available.
