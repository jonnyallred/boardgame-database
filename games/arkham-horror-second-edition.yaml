# Description
description: |
  Arkham Horror (2nd Edition) is the definitive epic cooperative investigation
  game of Lovecraftian horror, redesigned by Fantasy Flight Games from Richard
  Launius' 1987 original. One to eight investigators explore the streets and
  Other Worlds of 1920s Arkham, racing to seal six dimensional gates before an
  Ancient One — including Cthulhu, Hastur, or Ithaqua — awakens and destroys
  humanity. Players choose from 16 unique investigators, each with individual
  stats and starting equipment, rolling dice equal to relevant attributes where
  5s and 6s are successes. The sweeping board covers every district of Arkham,
  with monsters, gates, and clues spawning from an intricate card system. Known
  for its epic table presence and genuinely narrative sessions, the second edition
  spawned numerous expansions before being succeeded by the streamlined third
  edition in 2018.
