# Description
description: |
  Four Victorian-era literary legends clash in asymmetrical tactical combat.
  Sherlock Holmes (with Watson as sidekick), Dracula (with his three sisters),
  the Invisible Man, and Jekyll & Hyde each bring unique decks and abilities
  to the fight. Players maneuver their heroes across a shared map, playing
  cards to attack and defend with no dice - every outcome is determined by
  card play. Part of the Unmatched system, fully compatible with all other
  Unmatched sets for mix-and-match battles.
