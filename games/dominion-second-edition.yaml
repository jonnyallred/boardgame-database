# Description
description: |
  The second edition of the genre-defining deck-building game. Players start
  with a small deck of basic cards and acquire new, more powerful cards from
  a shared supply each turn. Build your deck into an efficient engine while
  racing to collect the most Victory Points. This edition updates artwork,
  streamlines rules, and replaces six Kingdom cards from the original with
  new ones for improved gameplay. Each game uses 10 of 26 Kingdom card types,
  ensuring high replayability.
