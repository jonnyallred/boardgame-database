# Description
description: |
  A fully cooperative deck-building game where breach mages defend the last
  underground city of Gravehold against powerful nemeses. Unlike most deck
  builders, you never shuffle your discard pile — the order you discard cards
  determines the order you draw them, making every decision consequential.
  Turn order is randomized each round, simulating the chaos of battle. Players
  combine spells, gems, and relics in unique combinations tailored to each
  breach mage's abilities to defeat escalating nemesis attacks.
