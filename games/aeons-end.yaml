# Description
description: |
  Cooperative deck-building game where players are breach mages defending
  the underground city of Gravehold from The Nameless. Features a unique
  no-shuffle mechanic where the order you discard cards matters, a variable
  turn order system that simulates the chaos of battle, and breaches that
  must be opened to cast powerful spells. Each game uses a different
  combination of nemesis, mages, and market cards for high replayability.
