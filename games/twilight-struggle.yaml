# Description
description: |
  Twilight Struggle: The Cold War, 1945-1989 is a two-player card-driven strategy game
  designed by Ananda Gupta and Jason Matthews, published by GMT Games in 2005. Players
  represent the United States and Soviet Union in their decades-long ideological and
  geopolitical struggle for global influence.

  The game uses a card-driven mechanism where each card represents a historical event
  from the Cold War. When played, a card can either trigger its event (which may benefit
  either side regardless of who plays it) or be used for Operations points to place
  influence, conduct coups, or advance on the Space Race track. This dual-use system
  creates agonizing decisions: playing an opponent's powerful event to gain ops points,
  or holding it to deny them the event?

  Play is divided into three phases — Early War, Mid War, and Late War — each adding new
  cards reflecting historical developments. Victory is tracked via a Defcon track (nuclear
  war ends the game immediately) and a global influence scoring system. Once ranked the
  number one game on BoardGameGeek, Twilight Struggle is widely considered one of the
  greatest two-player games ever designed, beloved for its historical authenticity and
  the relentless pressure it places on both players.
