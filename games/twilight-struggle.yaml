# Description
description: |
  Relive the Cold War in this two-player card-driven game. The US and USSR
  battle for global influence from 1945 to 1989. Play cards for their event
  or operations points, but opponent events still trigger when you play
  their cards. Tension builds toward potential nuclear war. A landmark
  design that defined modern card-driven wargames.
