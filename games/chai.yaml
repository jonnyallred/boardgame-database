  Chai is a tea-themed set collection game where players step into the shoes of tea merchants
  blending the perfect cup. Players specialize in one of five tea types — rooibos, green, oolong,
  black, or white — and purchase ingredients to fulfill customer orders. On each turn, players
  either visit the market to receive a gold coin and select flavor tiles, or collect additives
  like milk, sugar, honey, vanilla, and spices needed to complete most orders. Fulfilling customer
  orders earns victory points, with more complex orders yielding higher rewards. The game's
  relaxed pace and beautiful artwork create a cozy atmosphere perfectly suited to its theme.
  A successful Kickstarter campaign raised over $110,000 and the game found a warm global
  audience among casual gamers who appreciate its immersive tea culture theme.
