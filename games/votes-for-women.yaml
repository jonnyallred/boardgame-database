# Description
description: |
  Votes for Women is a card-driven strategy game covering the American women's
  suffrage movement from 1848 to 1920, culminating in the ratification — or
  rejection — of the Nineteenth Amendment. One player represents the
  Suffragettes while the other plays the Opposition, each adding and removing
  influence across states in a tug-of-war for support.

  The game supports competitive two-player, cooperative, and solo modes. In
  cooperative and solo play, players face an "Oppobot" automaton system. Cards
  drive both events and campaigning actions, echoing the Twilight Struggle
  style of card-driven wargames. The production is lavish, featuring a beautiful
  period-style board, wooden components, and facsimiles of historical documents
  from the era. The game was produced in partnership with the League of Women
  Voters.
