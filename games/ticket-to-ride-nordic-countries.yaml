# Description
description: |
  A standalone Ticket to Ride designed specifically for 2-3 players,
  featuring a map of the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway,
  Sweden). Collect train cards to claim railway routes connecting cities
  throughout Scandinavia. Incorporates tunnel routes and ferry routes
  requiring locomotive cards, adding tactical depth. The smaller player
  count creates a tighter, more competitive experience with increased
  blocking opportunities compared to the base game.
