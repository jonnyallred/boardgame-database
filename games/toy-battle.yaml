# Description
description: |
  Toy Battle is a fast-playing two-player tactical duel in which players deploy toy troops across whimsical battlefields—ranging from castle fields and volcanic jungles to space stations. Each turn a player either draws two troop tiles to their rack or plays one tile onto a board space orthogonally connected to their headquarters, triggering its special ability. Units have unique powers—soldiers call reinforcements, ducks defeat anything but lose to all, and robots attack from a distance—while a numerical superiority system means higher-numbered tiles capture lower ones. Victory comes by either placing a troop directly on the opponent's headquarters or controlling the most medal-bearing territories when troops run out. Eight interchangeable double-sided terrain boards keep every game fresh, and matches rarely exceed fifteen minutes.
