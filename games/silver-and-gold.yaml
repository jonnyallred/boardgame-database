# Description
description: |
  Silver & Gold is a flip-and-write game published by Pandasaurus Games in 2019, designed by Phil
  Walker-Harding (Sushi Go!, Imhotep, Bärenpark). Rather than dice, the game uses a deck of cards
  that reveal Tetris-style polyomino shapes each round, which all players simultaneously mark on their
  individual island treasure map cards using dry-erase markers.

  Each player has a hand of island cards — double-sided, wipeable map cards — and tries to fill them
  completely to score points and move on to new islands. When a shape card is flipped, every player
  places X marks matching that shape anywhere on their current island. Completing an island scores
  points plus any bonuses shown (palm trees for extra points, anchors for extra drawings, coins for
  immediate points). A special red X on each card provides a bonus for the player who covers it first.

  Silver & Gold is praised for its satisfying puzzle-solving feel, near-zero downtime (everyone plays
  simultaneously), and elegant elegance — all the satisfying polyomino-fitting joy of a spatial puzzle
  in a 20-minute filler package.
