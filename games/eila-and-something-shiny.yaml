description: |
  Eila and Something Shiny is a story-driven cooperative adventure game told across five chapters
  with branching narrative paths. Players guide the main character Eila through a richly illustrated
  world, making choices that affect each chapter and ultimately determine how the story ends.
  The game blends puzzle solving, resource management, and cooperative decision-making in a
  format suitable for solo play or small groups. Beautiful illustrated comics bring the story
  to life, and the branching structure encourages replayability as different choices lead to
  different outcomes. The game emphasizes emotional storytelling and player agency in a compact
  format, making it particularly appealing for couples or players seeking a narrative gaming
  experience without heavy rules overhead.
