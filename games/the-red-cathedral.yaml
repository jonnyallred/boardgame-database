# Description
description: |
  Compete as architects building Saint Basil's Cathedral in Moscow under
  the Tsar's orders. Each turn choose one of three actions: claim a
  cathedral section, build sections by spending resources, or acquire
  resources from a shared market driven by a clever dice rondel. The
  dice rondel is the heart of the game - roll and place dice on a
  circular market where their values determine resource quantities,
  creating a dynamic puzzle of timing and opportunity. Build efficiently,
  complete sections for prestige, and earn the Tsar's favor.
