# Description
description: |
  Set during the onset of a great ice age, players each control one of six
  animal classes — mammals, reptiles, birds, amphibians, arachnids, and
  insects — competing for dominance across a modular hex landscape. Through
  worker placement on an action display, players adapt their species,
  spread across terrain tiles, and trigger scoring through dominance cards.
  Actions resolve top-to-bottom after all pawns are placed, creating tense
  planning and blocking decisions. A landmark design blending Euro-style
  worker placement with aggressive area control.
