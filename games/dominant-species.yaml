# Description
description: |
  Players control one of six animal classes — mammals, reptiles, birds, amphibians,
  arachnids, or insects — competing for survival as the planet slides into an Ice Age.
  Each turn, players place action pawns on a shared action display to claim actions
  like speciation, migration, glaciation, and competition, then execute them in strict
  order. Species adapt by adding or removing elemental requirements, spread across a
  hex-tile map, and drive rivals to extinction. The animal class best adapted when the
  last glacier tile falls claims dominance.
