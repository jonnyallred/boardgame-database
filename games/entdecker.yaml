description: |
  Entdecker: Exploring New Horizons is a tile-placement exploration game designed by Klaus Teuber
  that starts with a blank board representing an uncharted sea. Players take turns drawing and
  placing tiles that gradually reveal islands across the board. Players pay to place settlements,
  bases, or scouts on newly discovered islands, trying to establish dominance before rivals do.
  When an island is completed — fully surrounded by sea tiles — players with the most presence
  score victory points based on the island's size. The game rewards careful resource management
  alongside strategic positioning, as players must balance the cost of claiming territory against
  the points earned when islands are finally revealed. The gradual emergence of the map creates
  a satisfying sense of discovery and competitive tension.
