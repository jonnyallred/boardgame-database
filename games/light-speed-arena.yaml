# Description
description: |
  Light Speed: Arena is a real-time simultaneous tile placement game set in a futuristic
  space combat arena. In each 10-second round, all players simultaneously place one
  spaceship tile anywhere on the shared battlefield — positioning their ships' weapons
  and shields to deal maximum damage to opponents while protecting their own fleet.
  After 8 rounds of frantic placement, players use the companion app's Scan & Play
  feature: they photograph the table and the app automatically detects every tile's
  position and orientation, then plays out the battle and calculates scores. Points
  are earned by destroying enemy ships, collecting minerals from asteroid tiles, and
  impressing in-game sponsors. The game supports 2-4 players out of the box and
  expands to 6 with expansions. Funded via Kickstarter in 2024 and distributed at
  retail by Ares Games, Light Speed: Arena is notable for its "Scan & Play" mechanic
  that eliminates manual bookkeeping and delivers a complete combat resolution in seconds.
