# Description
description: |
  Cooperative deduction game where players work as bomb disposal experts
  to defuse 66 escalating explosive scenarios. Players place numbered
  wire tiles on stands and take turns pointing at teammates' wires,
  guessing their values. Correct guesses cut wires safely; wrong guesses
  advance the detonator. Communication is limited to information tokens
  and face-up wires, creating tense logical puzzles. Scenarios unlock
  progressively, bending core rules with new challenges.
