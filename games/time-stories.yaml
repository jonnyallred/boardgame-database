# Description
description: |
  T.I.M.E Stories is a narrative cooperative board game where players become temporal agents of the T.I.M.E Agency, traveling through time to prevent paradoxes and temporal anomalies. Players "decksplore" by moving through a deck of 120+ cards representing panoramic locations and encounters, inhabiting the bodies of people in different time periods to solve mysteries and complete missions.

  Each scenario takes place in a unique setting with its own story, challenges, and often unique mechanics. The base game includes the Asylum scenario set in a 1920s psychiatric hospital. The game emphasizes puzzle-solving, deduction, and efficient use of Temporal Units, as players often need multiple "runs" through a scenario to gather information and ultimately succeed. Each expansion scenario offers a completely new adventure in different time periods and settings, from medieval fantasy to Hollywood noir to Antarctic expeditions.
