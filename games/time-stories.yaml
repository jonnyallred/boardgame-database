# Description
description: |
  A cooperative "decksploration" game where players are temporal agents sent
  by the T.I.M.E Agency into the bodies of beings across different worlds
  and time periods to prevent paradoxes threatening the universe. Each
  scenario consists of a deck of 120+ cards forming panoramic locations that
  players explore using a shared pool of Temporal Units, with failed
  attempts sending agents back to retry with accumulated knowledge. The
  base game includes the Asylum scenario, with additional scenarios
  available as expansions.
