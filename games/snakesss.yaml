# Description
description: |
  Snakesss! is a social deduction trivia game for 4-8 players designed by Phil Walker-Harding
  (creator of Sushi Go!). At the start of each round, players are secretly assigned roles: most
  are ordinary humans, but one or more become Snakes, and one is the Mongoose of Truth. Only
  the Snakes get to see the correct answer to the trivia question. After a brief discussion
  period where Snakes try to mislead others, everyone simultaneously votes on their chosen
  answer. Humans score points for guessing correctly, Snakes score by leading humans astray,
  and the Mongoose scores by identifying who the Snakes are. The game includes over 120
  question cards and delivers a quick, chaotic blend of trivia and deception.
