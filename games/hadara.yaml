# Description
description: |
  Hadara is a civilization card-drafting game in which players guide the growth
  of their own civilization across three epochs. A central rotating dial
  determines which card decks are available each round, and players take turns
  selecting cards to add to their tableau, representing the diverse peoples,
  leaders, and achievements of cultures from around the world and throughout
  history.

  Each card belongs to one of five colors representing different aspects of
  civilization: food supply, income, culture, military strength, and a fifth
  wild category. Players must balance all five tracks simultaneously, as food
  limits how many cards can be kept, income funds card purchases, culture
  generates victory points, and military provides end-game scoring bonuses.
  Cards not chosen can be sold for coins rather than drafted.

  At the end of each epoch, players score based on their lowest-value track
  (encouraging balanced development), then a new epoch begins with more
  powerful cards becoming available. The game rewards careful tableau
  construction and hand management while remaining accessible enough for
  family play. Originally published in Germany by Hans im Glück, it received
  widespread praise for distilling civilization-building into an elegant,
  under-an-hour experience.
