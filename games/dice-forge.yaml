# Description
description: |
  Dice Forge is a dice-crafting game published by Libellud in 2017 in which players compete
  to earn the favor of the gods by upgrading their custom dice. The game's signature mechanic
  involves physically removing and replacing faces on each player's two dice, customizing
  the distribution of resources — gold, sun shards, moon shards, and glory points — they
  generate each turn. At the start of every player's turn, all players roll their dice and
  collect resources, ensuring constant engagement. Resources are spent at the Forge to
  purchase new die faces or at the Temple to undertake heroic deeds. The heroic deeds
  provide bonus effects, powerful artifacts, and victory points. The game features gorgeous
  production quality with intricate custom dice and detailed card art depicting Greek
  mythology themes.
