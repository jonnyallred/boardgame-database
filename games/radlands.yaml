# Description
description: |
  A competitive two-player dueling card game set in a post-apocalyptic
  wasteland. Each player leads a band of punks fighting to destroy the
  rival tribe's three camps. Water is the primary resource, spent to
  deploy people and events or activate card abilities. Characters are
  played in front of camps to protect them, and both players draw from
  a shared deck. Cards can be played to the table or junked for
  immediate effects, creating tense decisions every turn. Victory comes
  from identifying fierce card synergies and managing resources wisely.
