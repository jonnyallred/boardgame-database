# Description
description: |
  Atlantis Rising (Second Edition) is a fully cooperative worker placement game
  in which 1-7 players take on the roles of the leaders of a doomed island civilization.
  Atlantis is sinking, and the heroes must gather resources to construct a magical
  cosmic gate before the island is completely submerged.

  Each round, players deploy their citizen workers across the island to gather
  resources, but the further workers are placed toward the shore, the greater the
  risk — dice determine whether workers at vulnerable locations are swallowed by
  the floodwaters. The Wrath of the Gods phase each round floods a set number of
  tiles, shrinking the available board and adding urgency.

  Players control one of several Councilor roles, each with unique powers, and must
  cooperatively decide how to allocate limited resources toward gate components.
  The second edition revised and expanded the Councilor powers, updated the narrative
  structure, and improved component quality. Atlantis Rising is praised for its
  thematic tension and high player counts for cooperative play.
