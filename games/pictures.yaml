# Description
description: |
  Pictures is a creative party game in which players simultaneously attempt to
  recreate a secret photograph using one of five very different sets of components:
  shoelaces, wooden sticks and stones, colored cubes, icon cards, or building
  blocks. A 4x4 grid of photo cards is laid out on the table, and each player
  draws a coordinate chip from a bag indicating which photo they must represent.
  Using only their assigned set of materials, they build or arrange an
  abstract representation of the image, then all players try to guess which
  photo each other person depicted.

  Players score points both for correctly guessing others' pictures and for
  having their own picture guessed. The game lasts five rounds, rotating
  through all material sets so every player experiences each one. The
  constraint of working with unconventional, limited materials is the heart
  of the design — a shoelace can suggest a horizon, a road, or a smile, while
  a handful of stones can become a mountain range or a face.

  Pictures won the 2020 Spiel des Jahres award, praised by the jury for its
  elegance, accessibility, and the way it sparks creativity and laughter
  across all types of players. Its simultaneous play keeps everyone engaged
  throughout and eliminates downtime entirely.
