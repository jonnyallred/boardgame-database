description: |
  Clockwork Wars is an area control game where 2-4 players command unique races of creatures
  in a tense war across a steam-era alternate universe where magic and technology collide.
  Players simultaneously write their planned disc placements for each turn, then simultaneously
  reveal and execute — creating suspense and requiring careful prediction of opponents' moves.
  When multiple players contest the same territory, combat resolves based on unit counts with
  special abilities potentially tipping the balance. Victory points flow from controlling
  territories containing natural resources across seven rounds. Players develop technology
  through espionage and research, unlocking powerful abilities. The combination of simultaneous
  secret planning with asymmetric faction powers creates a game of bluffing, prediction, and
  aggressive strategic positioning.
