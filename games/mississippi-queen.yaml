# Description
description: |
  Mississippi Queen is a riverboat racing game in which 3 to 5 players captain paddle steamers
  competing to be the first to reach New Orleans. The river is revealed tile by tile as the
  steamboats move downstream, so no one knows what twists and turns lie ahead.

  Each turn, a player may increase or decrease their speed by 1 for free; further adjustments
  cost coal. Managing a limited coal supply is the heart of the game — going too fast makes it
  impossible to navigate sharp bends, while falling behind means rivals collect passengers first.
  Players must stop at two passenger docks along the river, picking up one passenger each time,
  and be the first to arrive at the final dock with both passengers aboard and a speed of exactly 1.

  The modular hex-tile river board creates a different race course every game, ensuring high
  replayability. Mississippi Queen won the Spiel des Jahres award in 1997, praised for its elegant
  blend of accessible rules and meaningful decisions around speed and resource management. The
  Black Rose expansion adds a sixth player and a pirate ship that can steal passengers, adding
  a chaotic but fun layer of interaction.
