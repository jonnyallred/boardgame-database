description: |
  Gravwell: Escape from the 9th Dimension is a racing game where players pilot space vessels
  trapped within a Singularity, racing to escape through a Warp Gate. Each round players
  draft fuel cards from piles where only the top card is visible, then simultaneously reveal
  and resolve their chosen cards in alphabetical order. Most cards move your ship toward the
  nearest object — which could be another player's ship or the starting zone — making movement
  wonderfully chaotic and unpredictable. The nearest ship can change by the time your card
  resolves due to prior moves in the same round. One emergency stop card per round adds a
  last-ditch tactical option. The clever gravity-based movement system creates hilarious
  moments where players inadvertently drag each other backward or catapult opponents forward.
