# Description
description: |
  A streamlined reimplementation of Age of Steam where rival railways
  compete to build track networks and deliver goods for profit. Players
  bid for turn order and select actions such as laying track, upgrading
  locomotives, or growing towns into cities. Each delivery forces a
  strategic choice between immediate victory points or long-term income,
  making cash management critical throughout the game.
