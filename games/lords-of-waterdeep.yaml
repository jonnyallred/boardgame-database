# Description
description: |
  A worker placement game set in the Dungeons & Dragons city of Waterdeep.
  Players take the roles of masked Lords secretly vying for control of the city
  by deploying agents to gather adventurers, collect gold, draw Intrigue cards,
  and complete Quests worth victory points. Each Lord has a hidden identity with
  bonus scoring conditions that reward specific quest types. Intrigue cards let
  you meddle with opponents, adding a layer of take-that to an otherwise
  approachable euro framework. An excellent gateway into heavier worker placement.
