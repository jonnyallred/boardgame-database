description: |
  Daruma is a press-your-luck dice game inspired by traditional Japanese daruma dolls — used as
  symbols of goal-setting and perseverance. Players roll dice and use results of 1 to paint
  the eyes of daruma dolls on the table. Each time you paint an eye, you earn an additional
  action to modify or re-roll remaining dice, allowing you to chain combos and keep placing
  eyes. The push-your-luck tension comes from knowing when to stop and secure your darumas
  versus risking more rolls to extend your chain. The game is portable and compact — designed
  to be played on a bar table or airplane tray — making it an ideal filler for any occasion.
  Players compete to collect the most completed darumas by the end of the game.
