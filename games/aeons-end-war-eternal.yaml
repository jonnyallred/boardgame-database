# Description
description: |
  Standalone sequel to Aeon's End. Cooperative deck-building game where
  players defend the last bastion of humanity, Gravehold, against The
  Nameless and their hordes. Features a unique no-shuffle mechanism where
  the order you discard cards matters, and a variable turn order system
  that simulates the chaos of battle. Fully compatible with the original
  Aeon's End.
