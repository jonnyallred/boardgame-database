# Description
description: |
  The Tea Dragon Society Card Game is a gentle fantasy card game for 2-4 players based on the
  award-winning graphic novel series by Katie O'Neill. Players nurture adorable tea dragons
  throughout the seasons of a year, collecting memory cards and building relationships with
  their companions. On each turn, players tend to tea dragons by playing season cards to grow
  them, harvest the tea they produce, and collect memories tied to those teas. The game is
  cooperative in spirit but competitive in scoring, with players earning points for the memories
  they collect and the dragons they care for. The artwork by graphic novelist Katie O'Neill gives
  the game a warm, illustrated-book aesthetic that makes it stand out on any game table. It
  appeals especially to fans of the source material and those seeking a relaxed, low-conflict
  gaming experience with beautiful production values.
