# Description
description: |
  Compete to supply electricity to the most cities across a shared map.
  Players bid in fierce auctions for power plants, buy resources from a
  fluctuating commodity market, and expand their networks across connected
  cities. Turn order is determined by who is in the lead, giving trailing
  players advantages in purchasing. The resource market dynamically adjusts
  based on consumption and resupply, creating tense economic decisions.
  A landmark economic strategy game by Friedemann Friese.
