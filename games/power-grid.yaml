# Description
description: |
  Compete to supply electricity to the most cities by building a power network
  across a map of interconnected cities. Bid in auctions for power plant cards,
  buy resources from a fluctuating market, and expand your network by purchasing
  cities. The player powering the most cities wins — but the turn order mechanic
  ensures leaders go last in auctions and city-buying, creating a tight and
  punishing balancing act throughout. A multiplayer economic classic.
