# Description
description: |
  Dream Home is a family card-drafting and room-placement game published by R&R Games in
  2016. Players simultaneously draft two cards each round — one room card and one helper
  card — from a shared tableau, placing rooms to build their ideal house. Each room card
  shows a room type, and certain combinations of adjacent rooms score bonus points. Helper
  cards provide special abilities and additional scoring opportunities. The game features
  charming artwork depicting cozy domestic spaces, and its simple drafting mechanism makes
  it accessible to families and younger players. Strategy comes from anticipating which
  cards opponents will take, planning room layouts for combo bonuses, and using helper
  cards at optimal moments. Dream Home plays in under an hour and serves as an excellent
  introduction to drafting games.
