# Description
description: |
  Löwenherz (German for "Lionheart") is a territory-control game set in medieval Europe, designed
  by Klaus Teuber and published by Goldsieber in 1997. It won the Deutscher Spiele Preis in 1997
  and was nominated for the Spiel des Jahres, making it one of Teuber's most acclaimed designs
  alongside The Settlers of Catan and Entdecker.

  Players take on the roles of rival regents seeking to claim and control land in a fragmented
  kingdom. The game is played on a modular board assembled from smaller tiles, creating a different
  map each session. Each player begins with castles, knights, and a starting manor surrounded by
  walls. The goal is to enclose additional territories with walls, with each enclosed region
  scoring points based on its size and the castles it contains.

  The heart of the game is its card-driven action system. Each round, an action card is revealed
  showing three possible actions — such as building walls, moving knights, gaining money, or
  attacking — and players simultaneously bid or negotiate to claim their preferred action. When
  two or more players select the same action, they must negotiate, with one player potentially
  compensating the other to resolve the conflict. This creates a rich layer of diplomacy and
  deal-making alongside the spatial puzzle of territory enclosure.

  The card deck is cleverly structured so that the types of actions available shift as the game
  progresses: early cards favour economic development while later cards introduce more aggressive
  military options. This pacing rewards players who understand the arc of the game. A 2003 revised
  edition titled Domaine (published in German as Löwenherz: Der König kehrt zurück by Kosmos and
  in English by Mayfair Games) streamlined the design and won the Schweizer Spielepreis.
