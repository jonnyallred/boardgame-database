# Description
description: |
  Classic Universal movie monsters terrorize a small village, and your team
  must work together to defeat them before terror overwhelms the town. Choose
  from seven iconic monsters - Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster, the Mummy,
  the Wolfman, the Invisible Man, the Creature from the Black Lagoon, and
  the Bride of Frankenstein - each with unique defeat conditions. Gather
  items, protect villagers, and solve each monster's puzzle while managing
  the escalating threat. Scalable difficulty by adding more monsters. An
  accessible cooperative game with beautiful production and strong theme.
