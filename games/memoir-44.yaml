# Description
description: |
  Memoir '44 is an accessible World War II wargame that recreates famous battles
  from D-Day and beyond. Players command Allied or Axis forces across a hex-based
  battlefield using command cards to order units in different sections of the board.
  Combat is resolved with custom dice. With over 15 scenarios in the base game
  covering operations like Omaha Beach, Pegasus Bridge, and the Ardennes, the
  game delivers tense tactical decisions in a streamlined, fast-playing format.
  The Commands & Colors system makes it one of the best gateway wargames available.
