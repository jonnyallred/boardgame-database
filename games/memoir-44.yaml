# Description
description: |
  Memoir '44 is a two-player WWII wargame using Richard Borg's Command and Colors
  system, published by Days of Wonder in 2004. Players command Allied or Axis forces
  across historically grounded scenarios based on famous battles from the European
  theatre, including D-Day landings, Operation Market Garden, and the Battle of the
  Bulge.

  Gameplay is driven by a hand of Command Cards that determine which sections of
  the hex board a player may activate — left flank, center, or right — and how many
  units can be ordered. Players roll custom battle dice whose icons resolve combat,
  making every engagement fast and punchy. Infantry, armor, and artillery units each
  have distinct movement and combat rules, while terrain like hedgerows, rivers, and
  towns creates tactical friction true to the historical settings.

  Scenarios are set up from a scenario booklet and played on a double-sided board,
  giving the game a modular, replayable structure. Victory is earned by capturing
  enemy medal objectives or eliminating opposing units. The game supports team play
  and larger Overlord scenarios (requiring two copies) for up to eight players.
  A deep catalog of expansions covers the Pacific, Eastern Front, Mediterranean,
  and other theatres. Memoir '44 won the 2004 International Gamers Award for General
  Strategy (2-player category).
