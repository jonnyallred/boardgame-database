# Description
description: |
  ShipShape is a light bidding and spatial puzzle game published by Calliope Games in 2019, designed by
  Rob Daviau. Players are pirate captains competing to fill their ship holds with the most valuable haul
  of treasure, cannons, and contraband over three voyages.

  Each round, players simultaneously select one of their numbered Crew cards (1-10) as a bid, then reveal
  them simultaneously. In descending bid order, players claim Crate tiles from the central stack — but
  higher bidders get first pick of the available tiles. The real puzzle comes from arranging foam-core
  Crate tiles in your ship's hold: tiles have cut-out windows that let lower layers show through, meaning
  only what is visible at game end scores. Strategic stacking and careful placement are key to maximizing
  your score. ShipShape delivers a satisfying combination of auction tension, spatial reasoning, and the
  tactile pleasure of assembling a physical 3D stack in a compact, family-friendly package.
