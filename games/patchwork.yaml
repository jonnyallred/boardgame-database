# Description
description: |
  Two players compete to build the most aesthetic quilt on a 9x9 grid.
  Purchase fabric patches from a shared market using buttons as currency,
  then fit them together on your board. A unique time track determines
  turn order - the player furthest behind always goes next. Balance
  spending buttons on patches versus saving for income rounds. Spatial
  puzzle meets economic optimization in this beloved two-player classic.
