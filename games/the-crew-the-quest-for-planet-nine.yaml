# Description
description: |
  The Crew: The Quest for Planet Nine is a cooperative trick-taking card game where players work together as astronauts on a mission to find the elusive ninth planet at the edge of the solar system. Unlike traditional trick-taking games, players must complete specific mission objectives across 50 increasingly difficult scenarios, with limited communication allowed - each player can reveal one card per mission using a special communicator token that indicates whether it's their highest, lowest, or only card in that suit. The game brilliantly combines the familiar mechanics of trick-taking with cooperative puzzle-solving, as players must deduce who can win which tricks based on minimal information sharing. Winner of the 2020 Kennerspiel des Jahres, The Crew offers accessible rules that teach in minutes while providing substantial tactical depth through its campaign structure, with each mission taking 5-10 minutes and presenting unique challenges that require careful coordination and deduction.
