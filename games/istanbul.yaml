# Description
description: |
  Istanbul is a Euro-style strategy game set in the bustling bazaar of Istanbul,
  where players take the role of merchants racing to be the first to collect five
  rubies. Each merchant has a team of four assistants who must be dispatched across
  a 4x4 grid of location tiles — and then retrieved — to enable actions at each
  destination.

  On their turn, players move their merchant (and any remaining stack of assistants)
  to an adjacent or diagonal tile. If no assistant is already there, they drop one
  off and immediately take the location's action — filling their wheelbarrow with
  goods, expanding wheelbarrow capacity, buying or trading goods for rubies, or
  gaining special abilities. If one of their assistants is already at a tile, they
  pick it back up and still take the action, but now they have one more assistant
  in their stack.

  This push-pull mechanic of deploying and recovering assistants creates a spatial
  puzzle: players need to plan efficient routes around the bazaar to always have an
  assistant available when needed, while also racing rivals to the most valuable
  locations. The modular board ensures high replay value — tiles are shuffled and
  laid out differently each game.

  Istanbul won the Kennerspiel des Jahres (Connoisseur's Game of the Year) in 2014
  and the Deutscher Spiele Preis the same year. It has been praised for its elegant
  blend of accessibility and strategic depth, with each decision carrying meaningful
  consequences without overwhelming new players.
