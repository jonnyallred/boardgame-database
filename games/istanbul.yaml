# Description
description: |
  Race through the bazaar of Istanbul to be the first merchant to collect
  five rubies. Lead your merchant and four assistants across a modular grid
  of 16 locations, dropping off and picking up assistants to perform actions
  like acquiring goods, expanding your wheelbarrow capacity, and trading at
  the market. Careful route planning is essential as you need assistants at
  locations to act. Winner of the 2014 Kennerspiel des Jahres.
