# Description
description: |
  A semi-cooperative survival game set in a zombie-infested colony where
  players must work together to complete a shared objective while secretly
  pursuing individual goals -- one of which may belong to a betrayer.
  Crossroads cards trigger narrative events based on game conditions,
  creating emergent storytelling moments. Features dice-driven actions,
  resource scavenging, and tense social dynamics around trust and betrayal.
