# Description
description: |
  Build the most powerful fantasy kingdom using just seven cards. Draw
  and discard to assemble combos of armies, wizards, weather, and
  artifacts, where every card modifies the scoring of others. The game
  ends when ten cards fill the discard area. Deceptively simple rules
  with deep combo potential and enormous replayability.
