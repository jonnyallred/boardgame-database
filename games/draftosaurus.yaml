# Description
description: |
  Draftosaurus is a fast and playful dinosaur drafting game for 2-5 players. Each round,
  players draw six dinosaur meeples from a bag and simultaneously draft one at a time,
  passing the remainder to the next player. The twist: one player rolls a placement die
  each turn, restricting where all other players may place their chosen dinosaur in their
  personal zoo board — only the die roller is free to place anywhere.

  Each player's zoo board is divided into themed enclosures with unique scoring rules:
  some score for matching species, others for mixed groups, pairs, or single specimens
  flanked by T-Rex tokens. Placed dinosaurs score at game end based on the conditions
  of whichever pen they occupy.

  The game plays over two rounds (four rounds at 2 players), making a typical session
  last about 15 minutes. Draftosaurus is notable for its tactile dinosaur meeples, its
  highly accessible rules, and its ability to introduce the drafting mechanic to new
  players in the most charming possible format. Designed by a four-person team including
  Antoine Bauza, it won the As d'Or — Jeu de l'Année (France) in 2020.
