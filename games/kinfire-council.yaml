# Description
description: |
  Kinfire Council is a competitive worker placement and political strategy game set in the
  Kinfire Chronicles universe. Players are members of the Council tasked with rebuilding
  the great city of Din'Lux and defending it from the dangers of the Starless Nights.

  Each round, players send workers to collect resources, upgrade buildings, and construct
  Kinfire lighthouses while the Cult of Altan schemes against them. Players vote on
  important city policies (Decrees), arrest cultists, and dispatch their personal Seeker
  to thwart threats. The city evolves dynamically as districts are upgraded, decrees pass
  or fail, and new threats emerge — making each session play out differently.

  Designed by Kevin Wilson (Arkham Horror, Descent), Kinfire Council blends layered
  Euro-style resource management with meaningful player interaction and political
  negotiation. The voting system creates organic diplomacy as players maneuver to pass
  decrees that benefit their own strategy while blocking rivals. The game accommodates
  up to six players and completes within two hours, making it one of the more accessible
  heavy euros at higher player counts.
