# Description
description: |
  Aquatica is a deep-sea engine building card game in which players become epic
  sea-kings guiding their underwater kingdoms to dominance. Players explore the
  ocean abyss, gather resources, recruit powerful sea creatures, and capture
  underwater locations to score victory points.

  The game's central mechanic is a unique card-rising system: cards played from
  your hand slide into slots beneath your three-tiered player board. As you take
  actions, cards rise through the rows and eventually score when they reach the
  top. This creates a satisfying visual engine and a planning puzzle as players
  sequence their actions to maximize value.

  Aquatica features eight asymmetric sea-king factions with distinct starting powers,
  a solo mode, and a Clean Seas variant. Its relatively short play time, approachable
  rules, and striking oceanic artwork make it a popular mid-weight engine builder.
