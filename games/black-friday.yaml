# Description
description: |
  Black Friday plunges two to five players into a frantic stock market where
  they must accumulate as much gold as possible before the inevitable crash.
  Players earn cash by cleverly buying and selling shares across multiple
  commodity tracks, attempting to manipulate market prices to their advantage
  before dumping positions. The central tension is the looming collapse: the
  M.I.B.S. (minimally intelligent broker service) acts as an autonomous opponent
  that accelerates the market's decline. Timing the exit — knowing when to convert
  paper wealth into gold — is the game's defining challenge. Black Friday was
  the first entry in Friedemann Friese's Freitag Project, a series of games
  designed exclusively on Fridays; the volatile market dynamics and push-your-luck
  timing make it a distinctive economic filler.
