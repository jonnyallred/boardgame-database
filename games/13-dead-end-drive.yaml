# Description
description: |
  13 Dead End Drive is a darkly humorous murder-mystery board game published by
  Milton Bradley in 1993, set in a Victorian mansion after a wealthy old woman's
  death triggers a frantic battle for her inheritance. Each player secretly
  controls one or more of the twelve heir characters and must eliminate rivals
  using five strategically placed mansion traps — a chandelier, a fireplace, a
  suit of armor, a bookcase, and a lion's head — while keeping their own heirs
  alive. Portrait cards determine which character is currently the favorite heir,
  shifting the target. The hidden identity element means players must deduce which
  characters belong to which opponents before springing traps. With its 3D mansion
  board and genuinely chaotic gameplay, it became a beloved family game classic
  that has been reprinted by Winning Moves Games.
