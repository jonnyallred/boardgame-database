# Description
description: |
  Caverna: The Cave Farmers is an epic worker placement game where players lead dwarf families living in mountain caves. Often described as "Agricola for the people," Caverna offers a more sandbox-style experience compared to its predecessor, with less stress on feeding workers and more freedom to pursue diverse strategies. Players start with a farmer and spouse, expanding their family to unlock more actions each round over 12 turns. The game features dual board management: forest areas where players can clear land, plant fields, and raise animals, plus cave systems where dwarves mine for ore and rubies while furnishing rooms with special abilities. A key innovation is the adventure system—players can forge weapons and send armed dwarves on quests to gain resources, adding a unique dimension beyond pure farming. With 48 different room tiles offering varied strategic paths, an action board with increasing worker requirements, and support for 1-7 players including robust solo mode, Caverna provides exceptional depth and replayability. The game combines Rosenberg's signature resource conversion chains and polyomino puzzle elements with more forgiving feeding mechanics and multiple paths to victory, from animal breeding to mining to conquest, all wrapped in massive production quality with 300+ wooden components, acrylic gems, and beautifully illustrated boards by Klemens Franz.
