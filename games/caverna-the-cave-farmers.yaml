# Description
description: |
  Lead a small dwarf family living in a cave in the mountains. Place your
  dwarves as workers to farm the land, mine ore and rubies from the
  mountain, and furnish your caves with specialized rooms. Each round
  reveals new action spaces, and players must balance expanding their
  family with feeding them. A spiritual successor to Agricola that
  replaces card-driven asymmetry with a vast menu of building tiles,
  giving every player access to the same options while supporting
  diverse strategies. Includes adventure expeditions where armed
  dwarves can gather bonus resources and loot.
