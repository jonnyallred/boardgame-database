# Description
description: |
  Alcazar is an abstract strategy game designed by Wolfgang Kramer in which
  players compete to immobilize an opponent's pawn or occupy their starting
  castle. The board features a network of connected castle positions, and players
  alternate turns placing or moving walls between adjacent castles to reshape
  the paths available. A pawn enclosed within four walls is trapped and unable
  to move. The dual win conditions — trapping the enemy pawn or reaching their
  start space — create branching strategic paths and make defensive play
  insufficient. Short playtime and elegant mechanics make Alcazar a satisfying
  two-player abstract, with the option to play with up to five players in a
  team format.
