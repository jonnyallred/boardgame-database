# Description
description: |
  Draft beautiful Portuguese tiles to decorate your palace wall. Select
  tiles from factory displays - but leftover tiles go to the center,
  creating risk and opportunity. Complete rows, columns, and patterns
  for bonus points. Winner of the 2018 Spiel des Jahres. Elegant rules
  with meaningful decisions.
