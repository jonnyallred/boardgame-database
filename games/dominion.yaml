# Description
description: |
  The original deck-building game that launched a genre. Build your deck
  by acquiring cards from a common supply, then draw and play those cards
  on future turns. Start with a weak deck and build it into a well-oiled
  machine. Each game uses a different set of 10 Kingdom cards from a pool
  of 25, ensuring high replayability.
