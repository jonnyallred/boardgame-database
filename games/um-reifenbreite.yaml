# Description
description: |
  Um Reifenbreite ("By the Width of a Tire") is a cycling race board game designed by
  Rob Bontenbal, published by Jumbo in 1992. It won the Spiel des Jahres award that same
  year. The game traces its origins to Homas Tour, first published in 1979, which was
  later refined and relaunched as Um Reifenbreite.

  Players manage cycling teams of four riders racing along famous Tour de France-style
  routes. The game combines dice rolling for movement with card play that simulates
  tactical abilities like pushing to the front of the peloton or climbing mountain stages.
  Random event cards add unpredictable moments that evoke the drama of real professional
  cycling.

  The blend of luck and light tactical decisions captures the spirit of team cycling,
  where riders must sacrifice for team leaders and timing a sprint matters as much as
  raw speed. Um Reifenbreite is an accessible family racing game elevated by its
  thematic authenticity, and remains one of the most beloved Spiel des Jahres winners
  of the early 1990s.
