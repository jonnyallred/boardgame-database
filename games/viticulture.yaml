# Description
description: |
  Build and manage a vineyard in rustic Tuscany by planting vines, harvesting
  grapes, aging wine, and filling orders for visitors. The seasonal worker
  placement structure splits each year into summer and winter phases, each
  with distinct actions. A warm, thematic Euro that balances accessibility
  with strategic depth.
