# Description
description: |
  Viticulture is a worker-placement game set in the rolling hills of Tuscany
  where players build and manage their own winery. Each player starts with a
  small plot of land, a farmhouse, and a cellar, and must plant vines, harvest
  grapes, make wine, and fulfill orders to earn victory points.

  The game uses a seasonal structure — spring, summer, fall, and winter — with
  different worker-placement actions available each season. A clever wake-up
  order mechanic lets players choose when to act each year, balancing going
  early (fewer choices) versus going late (bonus benefits). Viticulture was
  Stonemaier Games' debut title, later refined into the Essential Edition (2015)
  with the Tuscany expansion content integrated.
