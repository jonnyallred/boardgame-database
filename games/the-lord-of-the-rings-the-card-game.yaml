# Description
description: |
  A cooperative living card game set in Tolkien's Middle-earth. Players
  build decks from four spheres of influence — Leadership, Tactics, Spirit,
  and Lore — and guide groups of heroes through dangerous quests. Each
  round involves committing characters to the quest, managing threat, and
  defending against enemies from an encounter deck. The LCG distribution
  model provides a massive library of expansion packs, saga expansions
  covering the novels, and standalone scenarios. Combines deep
  deckbuilding strategy with thematic storytelling across Middle-earth.
