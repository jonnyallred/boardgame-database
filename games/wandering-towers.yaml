# Description
description: |
  Wandering Towers is a whimsical race game by the celebrated design duo
  Wolfgang Kramer and Michael Kiesling. Players move their wizard meeples
  and large tower pieces around a ring of 16 spaces, trying to be first to
  guide their wizards into Ravenskeep, the central tower destination.

  On each turn, a player plays two of three cards from their hand indicating
  how many spaces to move a wizard or tower forward clockwise. When a moving
  tower overtakes a wizard, that wizard gets trapped inside and a potion bottle
  is filled. Filled potions grant bonus actions and are part of the win
  condition. The towering 3D components create a visually striking and
  tactilely satisfying game that plays well across a wide age range.
