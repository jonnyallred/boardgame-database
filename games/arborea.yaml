# Description
description: |
  Arborea is a worker-placement game in which players take the roles of Patron
  Spirits guiding villagers to heal and restore a mystical ecosystem. Workers are
  placed on shared Pilgrimage action tracks that physically advance all workers
  on them together, creating a timing-based tension where acting earlier yields
  less reward but secures priority. The game's signature mechanic is the personal
  Ecosystem board: players overlay terrain cards with six-square habitat tiles,
  stacking and layering them to create diverse habitats. Creatures scored at the
  intersections of four habitat squares provide the majority of victory points,
  with different species rewarding different adjacency combinations. The visual
  tableau of overlapping terrain creates a genuinely beautiful and ever-evolving
  personal landscape.
