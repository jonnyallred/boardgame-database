# Description
description: |
  Oranienburger Kanal is a 1-2 player strategy game set during the industrialization of 19th-century
  Brandenburg, Germany. The Oranienburg Canal — built between 1832 and 1837 to bypass difficult
  stretches of the Havel River — became a hub for mills and industries, and players take on the role
  of developers shaping this historical region.

  Players build new industries represented by cards, each with a unique ability that activates under
  specific conditions. A structure fires its ability once when it is fully surrounded by routes
  (pathways, streets, railways, and canals), and again when connected to at least two neighboring
  structures via bridges. This dual-activation system rewards careful spatial planning and creates a
  satisfying engine-building loop.

  Through worker placement and resource management, players erect buildings, lay infrastructure, and
  construct bridges to connect their industrial network. Bridges are the critical linchpin — a
  well-timed bridge placement can chain multiple activations and unlock powerful combos. At the end
  of the game, the player with the most valuable industrial area and strongest infrastructure wins.

  The game also features a full solo mode. Oranienburger Kanal won the International Gamers Award
  in 2023 in the two-player category, praised for its elegant interlocking systems and the way it
  captures Rosenberg's signature puzzle-like design sensibility.
