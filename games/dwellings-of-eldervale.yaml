# Description
description: |
  An epic worker placement game set in a fantasy realm of eight elemental
  lands. Place workers to gather resources, adventure into the wilds, and
  battle monsters and rival factions with custom dice combat. Build
  dwellings to claim territory, collect adventure cards to build your
  tableau engine, and harness elemental powers. Combines Euro-style worker
  placement and engine building with Ameritrash-style combat and miniatures
  for a unique hybrid experience.
