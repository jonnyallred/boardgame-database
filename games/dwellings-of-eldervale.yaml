# Description
description: |
  Dwellings of Eldervale is an epic fantasy worker-placement game in which giant elemental
  monsters roam while dragons, wizards, and warriors battle for dominance over eight elemental
  realms. Players control unique asymmetric factions, each with distinct abilities and worker
  units, seeking to adventure, battle, grow in power, and ultimately dwell Eldervale by shaping
  it to their vision.

  On each turn, a player either places one of their worker units onto a hex on the modular board
  or regroups — retrieving all workers and activating their tableau of adventure cards. Placing a
  worker claims the associated action (gathering resources, building dwellings, entering dungeons,
  or advancing elemental tracks) but may trigger combat if an opposing worker already occupies an
  adjacent space. Combat is dice-based, with the number of dice dictated by unit strength, adjacent
  dwellings, and other modifiers.

  Points are scored primarily through placing dwellings on the board — which are also used as area
  control markers — alongside dungeon rewards, elemental track bonuses, and tableau card effects.
  The game ends when a player places their last dwelling, prompting a final round. Dwellings of
  Eldervale blends Euro efficiency with Ameritrash conflict and spectacle, delivering a highly
  interactive sandbox experience with significant table presence and deep faction asymmetry.
