description: |
  Fief: France 1429 is a dynastic strategy game set in 15th century France where players assume
  the roles of noble families competing for power. Players vie for control of fiefs and bishoprics
  across the realm, acquiring royal and ecclesiastical titles that grant influence to elect the
  next King and Pope. The game combines territorial control through military battles with
  diplomatic negotiation, marriage alliances between noble families, and shrewd political
  maneuvering. Treachery runs deep — players can arrange assassinations, excommunications, and
  betrayals to undermine rivals. Coalition-building is essential, but alliances shift constantly
  as the balance of power changes. The rich political simulation, with its medieval power
  struggles and dynastic ambitions, creates emergent storytelling unlike most other games.
