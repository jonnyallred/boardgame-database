# Description
description: |
  3 Chapters is a fairy-tale trick-taking game that unfolds across three distinct
  mini-games in a single session. In Chapter 1, players draft their hand from
  eight beautifully illustrated companion cards, selecting one and passing the
  rest in a strategic selection round. Chapter 2 is a trick-taking contest where
  the highest card wins two points, but additional bonuses come from matching
  special skills on cards. Chapter 3 evaluates the value and attributes of the
  cards remaining in each player's final hand. The three-chapter structure gives
  the game a storybook arc and ensures that card selection in Chapter 1 has
  meaningful consequences in both subsequent phases, rewarding players who can
  see multiple steps ahead.
