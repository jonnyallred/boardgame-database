description: |
  Garden Party is a family board game where players compete to create the most beautiful garden
  to win a gardening contest. Players grow their garden, sometimes with the help of magical tools,
  but also trick, steal, or trap their opponents to gain advantage. The competitive gardening
  theme combines set collection and garden-building elements with player interaction through
  card play. Players must balance developing their own garden with interfering with rivals
  to ensure their garden is judged the finest at game end.
