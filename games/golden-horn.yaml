description: |
  Golden Horn is a trading and sailing game designed by Leo Colovini, set in the historic waters
  between Venice and Constantinople along the famous Golden Horn waterway. Players sail their
  ships across the Mediterranean, dealing with pirates and filling their warehouses with valuable
  goods. The game won the Austrian Game of the Year award in 2013 for its elegant design and
  accessible gameplay. Players plan sailing routes, collect goods at various ports, and fulfill
  trade demands for profit. The pirate threat adds an element of risk management, as traveling
  valuable cargo routes means potential losses to pirates. Colovini's design captures the romance
  of medieval maritime trade in a compact, family-friendly package.
