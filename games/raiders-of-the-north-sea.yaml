# Description
description: |
  Set in the Viking Age, players assemble a crew, collect provisions,
  and journey north to plunder settlements for gold, iron, and livestock.
  Features a unique place-one-worker, pick-up-another-worker mechanism
  that gives each turn two actions. Gather townsfolk cards to build your
  crew, manage your hand for optimal raids, and time your strikes to
  maximize victory points. Winner of the 2017 Kennerspiel des Jahres
  (Connoisseur Game of the Year).
