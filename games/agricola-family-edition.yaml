# Description
description: |
  Agricola: Family Edition is an accessible, streamlined version of Uwe Rosenberg's
  acclaimed worker placement game Agricola, designed to introduce younger players and
  casual gamers to the joys of farming in 17th-century Europe.

  Players take on the roles of farmers who must feed their family while expanding
  their homestead: plowing fields, sowing crops, raising livestock, and building
  rooms on their farmhouse. Each round, workers are placed on action spaces to claim
  resources and improvements, but space is limited and competition for the best
  actions is real.

  Compared to the full Agricola, the Family Edition removes the hand of cards,
  simplified the food requirements, and streamlines the scoring. The result is a
  45-minute game suitable for families and new gamers that still captures the
  satisfying tension of the original. It serves as an ideal gateway into the broader
  Agricola universe.
