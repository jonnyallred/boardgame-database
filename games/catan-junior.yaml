# Description
description: |
  Catan Junior is a simplified, pirate-themed introduction to the Catan universe designed for children aged 6 and up. Players take on the roles of rival pirate captains exploring a ring of tropical islands, collecting five types of resources — wood, goats, molasses, gold, and cutlasses — to build ships and pirate lairs. The first player to construct seven pirate lairs wins the game. A single die drives resource production, and a special Ghost Captain mechanic (triggered on a roll of 6) blocks one island and rewards the active player with free resources. Special Coco tiles act as a simplified card system, granting powerful one-time bonuses that add a touch of strategic decision-making to an otherwise accessible family experience.
