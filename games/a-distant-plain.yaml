# Description
description: |
  A Distant Plain is the third volume in Volko Ruhnke's acclaimed COIN (COunter-
  INsurgency) Series, modeling the complex multi-faction struggle in Afghanistan
  co-designed with simulation veteran Brian Train. Four deeply asymmetric factions
  — Coalition, Government, Taliban, and Warlords — each pursue entirely different
  objectives using unique action sets, making genuine four-player sessions
  especially tense. Coalition and Government must cooperate to stabilize the
  country despite competing visions, while the Taliban wages guerrilla insurgency
  and the Warlords exploit chaos for profit. The event card deck drives historical
  narrative including Pakistani posture mechanics, evolving tactics, and technology
  shifts. Like other COIN titles, it supports solitaire and two-player play through
  a bot system. Demanding to learn but among the most asymmetric and thematically
  resonant wargames available.
