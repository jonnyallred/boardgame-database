# Description
description: |
  A tactical dungeon-crawl campaign game set in the Star Wars universe, featuring
  two distinct modes of play. In the campaign game, one player controls the Imperial
  forces against 1-4 Rebel heroes in a series of linked narrative missions, while
  a separate skirmish mode lets two players compete head-to-head with custom strike
  teams. Players upgrade their heroes between missions, with the Imperial player
  adapting strategy based on Rebel accomplishments. Packed with detailed plastic
  miniatures and evocative Star Wars locations, it is heavily inspired by Descent.
