# Description
description: |
  Sheriff of Nottingham is a fast-paced bluffing and negotiation card game published by Arcane Wonders in
  2014, designed by Sergio Halaban, André Zatz, and Bryan Pope. Set in the world of Robin Hood, players are
  merchants attempting to bring goods through the city gates — legally or otherwise — while one player
  rotates as the Sheriff, deciding who to inspect and who to let through.

  On their turn, each merchant declares the contents of their pouch (always claiming to carry only legal
  goods) and hands it sealed to the Sheriff. The Sheriff must decide: trust the merchant and let them pass,
  or pay a penalty to inspect. If contraband is found, the merchant pays; if not, the Sheriff pays. Bribery
  and negotiation are encouraged, leading to deals, bluffs, and betrayals. The rotating sheriff role keeps
  everyone involved in the tension even out of their turn. Sheriff of Nottingham is a beloved social game
  known for the raucous table talk and memorable moments it generates.
