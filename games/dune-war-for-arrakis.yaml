# Description
description: |
  Dune: War for Arrakis is a highly asymmetric strategy miniatures game for 1-4 players,
  set during the Desert War depicted in the latter half of Frank Herbert's original 1965
  Dune novel. Designed by Marco Maggi and Francesco Nepitello, the team behind War of the
  Ring, the game recreates the desperate guerrilla conflict between House Atreides and House
  Harkonnen for control of the spice planet Arrakis.

  Players take command of radically different factions: the Harkonnen must dominate the
  planet by maintaining spice production and advancing their Supremacy track, principally
  by destroying Fremen Sietches; the Atreides and their Fremen allies must survive, grow,
  and ultimately strike decisive blows against the occupiers. Each faction has unique units
  — including Sardaukar, Fedaykin, and the legendary Paul Muad'Dib — and very different
  win conditions, playstyles, and card decks.

  The core system uses action dice to generate options each round, combined with numerous
  event cards that give each game a different flavour. Combat is resolved quickly with
  unit dice and shields, while leaders like Duncan Idaho and Stilgar add shields or bonus
  hits. The deep desert lurks as a constant threat: Sandworms can swallow harvesters whole,
  and survival in the open sands demands careful planning. The game supports solo and
  cooperative play against an automa system, and includes over 100 detailed miniatures
  representing the iconic characters and troops of Arrakis.
