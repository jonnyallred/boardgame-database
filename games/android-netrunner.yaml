# Description
description: |
  A deeply asymmetric two-player Living Card Game set in the dystopian Android
  universe, pitting a powerful megacorporation against a daring hacker. The corporation
  advances agendas hidden behind layers of ice (defensive programs), while the runner
  probes and breaches servers to steal them before they can be scored. Bluffing,
  resource management, and deckbuilding combine in a tense cat-and-mouse duel where
  every card played carries multiple strategic implications. Originally designed by
  Richard Garfield and revived by Fantasy Flight Games in 2012.
