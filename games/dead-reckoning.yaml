# Description
description: |
  Dead Reckoning is a 4X swashbuckling adventure game set in a Caribbean-esque archipelago where
  players command a privateer vessel and crew, sailing the high seas in pursuit of fame, fortune,
  and dominance. Designed by John D. Clair and published by AEG in 2022, the game blends the
  publisher's signature Card Crafting System with sweeping exploration, territory control, and
  naval combat.

  Each player begins the game with the same hand of 12 sailor cards that remain in hand for the
  entire game. The Card Crafting System allows players to upgrade individual cards by sleeving
  enhancement cards together, permanently improving crew members in ways that compound into
  powerful engines. Rather than drawing and discarding, players craft and customize, giving the
  game a distinctive feel compared to traditional deck builders.

  The game board is built from modular hex tiles representing islands, open sea, and ports,
  creating a different map each session. Players explore uncharted regions, establish and fortify
  outposts on resource-rich islands, run trading routes, hunt for buried treasure, and engage in
  ship-to-ship combat resolved through a unique cube tower mechanism. Crew cards and ship
  upgrades influence combat outcomes, rewarding strategic fleet development.

  Victory goes to the player who amasses the most treasure. Multiple viable strategies exist:
  aggressive piracy against opponents, peaceful exploration and cartography, merchant trading
  with developed infrastructure, or hybrid approaches. No single path to victory dominates,
  encouraging replayability and table diversity. A solo mode is included using an automa system.
  Expansions include the "Letters of Marque" and "Port of Call" Sagas, as well as the "Deep
  Legends" expansion.
