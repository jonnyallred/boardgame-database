description: |
  Eight-Minute Empire: Legends is a standalone sequel to Eight-Minute Empire that does not require
  the original game. Set in a fantasy world, players compete to build empires across a configuration
  of fantasy islands by drafting action cards and strategically placing armies and cities.
  Cards offer a good or an action (move armies, recruit armies, place cities, take resources, or
  use special powers), and at game end players score for area control across continents and
  sets of collected resource icons. Variable player powers from randomly assigned character cards
  differentiate each player's strategy. The Lost Lands expansion increases the player count to
  six. Like its predecessor, Legends packs surprising strategic depth into a very short playing
  time, making it an excellent gateway game or quick competitive filler.
