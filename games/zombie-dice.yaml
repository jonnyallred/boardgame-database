# Description
description: |
  Zombie Dice is a fast, addictive press-your-luck dice game from Steve Jackson
  Games, winner of the Origins Award for Best Family, Party or Children's Game
  of 2010. Players are zombies trying to eat more brains than their undead
  rivals. On your turn, pull three of the 13 custom dice from the cup and roll
  them — brains score points, shotgun blasts push you toward elimination, and
  runners can be rerolled.

  You may stop and bank your brains at any time, or keep rolling for more —
  adding new dice to the mix each time. Three shotgun blasts in a turn and you
  lose all your brains for that round. The first player to 13 brains wins.
  Plays in 10-20 minutes and can be taught in a single round, making it ideal
  for warming up game nights or filling short time windows. Multiple expansions
  add character dice with special rules.
