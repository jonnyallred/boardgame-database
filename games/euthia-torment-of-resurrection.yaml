description: |
  Euthia: Torment of Resurrection is an open-world fantasy RPG board game inspired by classic
  video games. Players take on the roles of one of up to eight unique heroes, each with different
  playstyles, branching ability paths, and specialist weapons. The game features procedurally
  generated hexagonal maps ensuring every session is different. Heroes explore the world,
  fight enemies, and grow in power from fledgling to legend. A notable feature is the resurrection
  mechanic — defeated players return to play rather than being eliminated, keeping everyone
  engaged. The game supports competitive, cooperative, and solo modes, and scenarios range from
  one to four hours. Its combination of deep character customization, exploration, and tactical
  combat positions it as a premium experience for fans of RPG-style board gaming.
