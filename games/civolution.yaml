# Description
description: |
  Civolution is a heavy euro civilization-building game in which players take on the role of local deities tasked with guiding their own civilizations through four eras of cultural, technological, and evolutionary development. Each turn, players select two dice from a shared pool of six to trigger one of 21 actions on their personal player board, managing resources, exploring a modular continent, and advancing along multiple progress tracks. A deck of 160 unique research cards provides enormous variety, allowing players to customize their civilization's development path through seemingly endless combinations. The game features limited direct conflict through area movement and territorial competition, keeping interaction competitive but focused on engine-building and long-term strategy. Designed by Stefan Feld and published by Deep Print Games in 2024, Civolution is considered one of Feld's most ambitious and replayable designs.
