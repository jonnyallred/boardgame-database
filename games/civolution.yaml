# Description
description: |
  Players assume the role of local deities guiding civilizations through four
  eras of development. Using a dice selection mechanism to trigger actions on a
  tech tree-like structure, players develop their societies through cultural,
  technical, and evolutionary choices. Each game explores only a fraction of
  the countless possibilities the modular system and many cards provide,
  competing to accumulate the most success points.
