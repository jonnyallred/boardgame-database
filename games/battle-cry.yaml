# Description
description: |
  Battle Cry is a two-player wargame that recreates fifteen battles from the
  American Civil War using Richard Borg's Commands & Colors system. Players
  command Union or Confederate forces — infantry, cavalry, artillery, and
  generals — arranged on a modular hex map with scenario-specific terrain tiles.
  On each turn, a player plays one Command Card to activate units in a chosen
  flank (left, center, or right), then rolls custom dice where rolled icons
  matching the defender's unit type remove figures. The first player to capture
  the required number of victory banners wins. Accessible enough for beginners
  yet tense for experienced wargamers, Battle Cry won the 2001 International
  Gamers Award for General Strategy and spawned the wider Commands & Colors
  system, including Memoir '44 and Commands & Colors: Ancients.
