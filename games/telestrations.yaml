# Description
description: |
  A hilarious party game based on the classic telephone game, where drawing and
  guessing go hilariously wrong. Each player sketches a secret word, then passes
  their sketchbook to the next player who guesses what was drawn, and the next
  player draws that guess, continuing around the table. The fun comes from seeing
  how wildly the original word transforms through successive rounds of sketching
  and guessing. Winner of the 2010 Best Party Game award.
