# Description
description: |
  The Princes of Florence is a classic Euro game for 2-5 players set in Renaissance Florence,
  where players compete as Medici-like patrons seeking to attract the greatest artists, scientists,
  and thinkers to their court. Over seven rounds, players alternate between an auction phase
  (bidding for jesters, builders, prestige cards, freedoms, and unique landscapes) and an action
  phase (constructing buildings and commissioning works). Each artist in your court has requirements
  that must be satisfied to complete a masterwork and score prestige points. The tension arises from
  the strict economy — you only have three actions per round and limited florins — forcing agonizing
  trade-offs between acquiring what you need at auction versus what your opponents want to deny you.
  Originally published by Alea in 2000, The Princes of Florence is considered a landmark of the
  golden age of Euro game design and remains highly regarded for its elegant depth.
