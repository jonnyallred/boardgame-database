# Description
description: |
  Kingdomino is a fast, elegant tile-placement game that won the 2017 Spiel des Jahres
  award. Players act as kings building a 5x5 kingdom by selecting and placing double-sided
  landscape tiles — each half showing one of six terrain types (wheat fields, forests,
  lakes, grasslands, swamps, or mountains) and possibly one or more crowns.

  Each round, players draft tiles from a face-up row, with turn order determined by the
  value of the tile chosen: grabbing a high-value tile with lots of crowns means going
  last in the next round, while taking a poor tile grants first pick. Players must place
  their chosen tile so that at least one side connects to a matching terrain type already
  in their kingdom (or to the central castle).

  Scoring is calculated at game end: for each contiguous region of matching terrain, multiply
  the number of tiles in that region by the number of crowns in it. The player with the
  highest total wins. The straightforward rules belie surprisingly tense decisions about
  blocking opponents, optimizing one's own grid, and managing turn-order trade-offs. Its
  domino-inspired design, short playtime, and elegant drafting mechanism make it a modern
  gateway classic.
