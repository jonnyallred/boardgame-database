# Description
description: |
  Run a hotel in fin de siècle Vienna as the Emperor's visit approaches.
  Each round, roll dice and draft them to serve café guests, hire staff,
  and prepare rooms. Dice showing different values unlock different actions—
  high numbers mean more power but fewer options. Serve guests their preferred
  food and drink, then move them into matching rooms to score points. Staff
  cards chain powerful combos. Emperor track creates a looming deadline.
  Elegant design from the Tzolk'in team with a wonderful Viennese atmosphere.
