description: |
  Donjons & Dominos is a cooperative dungeon-exploration game that uses a standard set of 28
  dominoes to create its dungeons — the spots on each domino represent different dungeon elements.
  Players explore the dungeon tile by tile, encountering monsters, finding treasures, and
  navigating the rogue-like layout revealed through domino placement. The game includes two
  booklets: a rules booklet and a scenarios booklet, plus character cards, treasure cards,
  and exploration cards. Designed by Romaric Briand as a project for his children during
  lockdown and self-published in 2022 through La Cellule, Donjons & Dominos offers an
  accessible and creative approach to dungeon crawling using everyday components.
