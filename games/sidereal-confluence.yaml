# Description
description: |
  Sidereal Confluence: Trading and Negotiation in the Elysian Quadrant is a grand trading and negotiation
  game for 4-9 players published by WizKids in 2017, designed by TauCeti Deichmann. Each player controls
  one of nine unique and asymmetric alien races, each with its own card deck representing technologies
  to research and converter cards that transform one set of resources into another.

  The core mechanic is simultaneous, free-form trading: all players negotiate openly at the same time,
  making deals to acquire the resource cubes their own economy needs but cannot produce alone. No race
  is self-sufficient — every civilization must trade to thrive. Turns are divided into a frenetic
  trading phase (where everything happens at once, keeping downtime minimal) and a production phase where
  converters activate and resources flow. Technology research allows races to upgrade their converters
  and score victory points.

  Inspired by Avalon Hill's Advanced Civilization and Sid Sackson's Bazaar, Sidereal Confluence occupies
  a unique niche: technically competitive, it plays with a deeply collaborative feel during trading as
  mutually beneficial deals dominate. A remastered edition was later published with updated components.
  The game is celebrated by enthusiasts as a singular, demanding experience unlike any other.
