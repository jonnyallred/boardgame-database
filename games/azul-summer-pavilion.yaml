# Description
description: |
  Azul: Summer Pavilion is the third game in the Azul series by Michael Kiesling,
  set in the Portuguese royal summer pavilion. King Manuel I has commissioned the
  most beautiful pavilion in the world, and players must decorate it with the finest
  tiles available.

  Like its predecessors, Summer Pavilion centers on drafting colorful tiles from
  shared factory displays and placing them onto a personal player board. The key
  difference is the player board: each of the six rounds focuses on one of six
  colored star patterns, and players must collect the correct combination of tiles
  to complete the stars on their pavilion.

  Wild tiles (representing the color of that round's featured star) add flexibility
  to tile collection, while the pattern-completion scoring rewards players for
  filling complete sections. Summer Pavilion is generally considered the most
  forgiving of the Azul games, with less harsh penalties for unplaced tiles, making
  it a popular entry point and standalone addition to the series.
