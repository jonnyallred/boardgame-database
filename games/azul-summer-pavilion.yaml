# Description
description: |
  The third game in the Azul series. Players are artisans tasked with
  creating ornate patterns for the royal Summer Pavilion of King Manuel I
  of Portugal. Over six rounds, draft colorful tiles from factory displays
  and strategically place them onto star-shaped patterns on your board.
  Each round features a wild color, adding variety and tactical options.
  Score points for tile placement, adjacency bonuses, and completing
  entire stars. End-game bonuses reward collecting complete sets and
  filling specific patterns. A step up in complexity from the original
  Azul while retaining the elegant drafting core.
