# Description
description: |
  War has come to Wonderland. As a Faction Leader invited to the
  Hatter's Tea Party, draft cards via a rondel to add chips to your
  bag, place followers across Wonderland's regions, and build your
  forces. Resolve battles by pulling chips from your bag in a
  press-your-luck showdown, but beware drawing Shard chips that
  topple your towers and knock you out of the fight. Control regions,
  unlock forge powers, and score set bonuses across multiple rounds
  to claim victory.
