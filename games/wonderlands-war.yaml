# Description
description: |
  Wonderland's War is a bag-building area control game set in a darkly twisted
  version of Wonderland. Players take on the roles of factions from Lewis
  Carroll's world — the Red Queen, the Hatter, the Cheshire Cat, the White
  Rabbit, and Alice — each vying for dominance over the fractured realm.

  Each round, players draft chips from a central pool and add them to their bags.
  Then, in the War phase, players draw chips from their bags to fight for control
  of regions on the modular board. Each faction has unique abilities and
  asymmetric powers that shape their strategic approach. The combination of
  drafting, bag-building, and area control creates a layered and distinctive
  experience. The deluxe edition features premium miniatures and components.
