# Description
description: |
  7 Wonders: Architects is a standalone, streamlined reimagining of the classic
  7 Wonders card game, designed specifically for families and new players.
  Players each build one of the Seven Wonders of the ancient world — the
  Pyramids, the Colossus, the Lighthouse, and others — by collecting resource
  cards, science cards, military cards, and more.

  On each turn, a player takes one of the three face-up cards from the central
  display. Cards provide resources to construct wonder stages, trigger progress
  tokens, or contribute to military conflicts. When a player completes their
  seventh wonder stage, the game ends and points are tallied. With no hand
  drafting, simplified scoring, and a 25-minute playtime, Architects strips
  away 7 Wonders' complexity while retaining its thematic appeal and the
  satisfying arc of building a civilization-defining monument.
