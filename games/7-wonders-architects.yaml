  A streamlined family-friendly version of 7 Wonders where players race to complete
  one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. On each turn, choose one of three
  available cards - from your personal deck, your neighbors' decks, or the shared
  central deck - and immediately apply its effect. Gather resources, build your
  wonder stages, advance your military, and collect scientific discoveries to score
  victory points. The game ends when the first player completes their wonder, ensuring
  a quick pace perfect for families and new players.
