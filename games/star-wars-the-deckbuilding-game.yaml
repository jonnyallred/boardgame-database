# Description
description: |
  A two-player head-to-head deckbuilding game pitting the Galactic Empire
  against the Rebel Alliance. Begin with asymmetric starting decks and
  strengthen them by acquiring cards from a shared galaxy row. Destroy
  three of your opponent's bases to win. Features a Balance of the Force
  tracker that grants additional card powers when controlled. Capital ships
  absorb damage to protect bases. Inspired by Star Realms with a Star Wars
  tug-of-war twist.
