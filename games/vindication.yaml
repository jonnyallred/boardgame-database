# Description
description: |
  Vindication is a strategic fantasy adventure board game designed by Marc Neidlinger and
  published by Orange Nebula in 2018. Players take on the roles of disgraced individuals
  washed ashore on a mysterious island, seeking to transform themselves through deeds of
  heroism and earn vindication.

  The game features a modular board built from tile draws, creating a fresh island layout
  each play. Players spend influence — the game's central currency — to gain companions,
  unlock character traits, discover mysterious relics, control map regions, and defeat
  horrific monsters. An attribute system tracks growth across multiple character
  dimensions as players accumulate Honor, the scoring currency.

  The emergent combo potential from companions, relics, and traits creates highly varied
  gameplay, with each path to Honor remaining viable. Vindication supports 1-5 players
  with a dedicated solo mode and has spawned several expansions. Known for exceptional
  component quality and a thematically rich redemption narrative, it is a fan favorite
  among those who appreciate sandbox-style exploration with strategic depth.
