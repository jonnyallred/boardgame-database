# Description
description: |
  Amun-Re transports three to five players to ancient Egypt, where they compete
  as rulers of great dynasties vying to build the most powerful civilization
  along the Nile. Each game spans two eras — Old Kingdom and New Kingdom — each
  consisting of three rounds of province auctions, resource purchases, and
  pyramid construction. Bidding for provinces uses triangular number pricing,
  creating a distinctive pressure curve that forces players to carefully balance
  expansion against treasury management. After each era, players publicly
  sacrifice gold to Amun-Re with the promise that generosity will be rewarded,
  though the deity's judgment is collective. Scoring rewards both pyramid counts
  and wealth at the midpoint and game's end, making both short-term income and
  long-term monument building equally viable paths. Winner of the 2003
  Deutscher Spiele Preis.
