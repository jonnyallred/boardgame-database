# Description
description: |
  Players act as art dealers buying and selling paintings by five fictional
  artists across four rounds. Each round, players auction paintings from
  their hand using four different auction types: open ascending, once
  around, sealed bid, and fixed price. At the end of each round, the
  most popular artists' works gain value based on how many paintings were
  sold. The key is knowing when to sell your own paintings and when to
  buy others' — the player with the most money after four rounds wins.
  A landmark auction game and Deutscher Spiele Preis winner.
