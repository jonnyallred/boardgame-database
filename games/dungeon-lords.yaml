# Description
description: |
  Dungeon Lords is a darkly humorous worker placement game designed by Vlaada Chvatil
  and published by Czech Games Edition in 2009. Players take on the role of dungeon
  lords competing to build the most impressive underground lair filled with monsters,
  traps, and evil minions. Each year is divided into seasons: during the dungeon-building
  phase, players secretly select actions on programming cards — mining tunnels, hiring
  monsters, acquiring spells, and collecting gold — while managing food, imps, and space.
  At year's end, adventuring parties invade each dungeon, and players must defend against
  increasingly powerful heroes. Scoring rewards evil deeds, trap placements, and defeated
  heroes. The simultaneous action selection creates kingmaking tensions as players try
  to predict and counter each other's plans. The game's rich humor, clever mechanics,
  and elaborate ruleset make it a favorite among experienced gamers.
