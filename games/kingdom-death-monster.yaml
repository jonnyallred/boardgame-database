# Description
description: |
  A cooperative campaign game of survival horror set in a nightmarish world of
  absolute darkness, where a small group of survivors must hunt monsters, craft
  gear from their remains, and build up a settlement across a 30-lantern-year campaign.
  Each session cycles through three phases: the hunt (a procedural journey), the showdown
  (tactical grid combat against a unique monster), and the settlement phase (managing
  resources, crafting, and the births and deaths of survivors). Famous for its
  extraordinarily detailed resin miniatures, punishing difficulty, and the sense that
  every campaign tells a unique story of triumph and tragedy.
