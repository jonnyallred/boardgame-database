# Description
description: |
  Federation is a sci-fi euro game in which each player leads a fledgling interplanetary government
  vying to join one of the powerful galactic federations. Over the course of five game years, players
  must prove their worth through diplomatic influence and economic development, impressing the
  bureaucrats who control access to federation membership.

  The game's signature mechanic is a double-sided worker placement system: each time you place a
  worker, you must choose which side faces up, determining whether that worker votes in favor of
  legislation beneficial to your cause or contributes funding to local improvement projects. At the
  end of each year, votes are tallied and the winning legislation grants points to players with the
  highest influence in the relevant area. This creates a constant push-and-pull between short-term
  resource gains and long-term political positioning.

  Players compete for area majority across different sectors, manage influence tracks, and pursue
  end-game bonus objectives, all while watching the legislative outcomes shift based on collective
  worker placement decisions. The interactive nature of the voting mechanic ensures that player
  choices are deeply intertwined, making Federation a notably social euro experience despite its
  relatively clean rule set.
