# Description
description: |
  Build the magnificent city of Teotihuacan across three eras (Eclipses).
  Workers are represented by dice that move around a rondel of action boards,
  growing in power as they gain experience. Collect cocoa and resources,
  research technologies, build and decorate the central pyramid, and worship
  at temples to earn the favor of the gods. A deeply interconnected Euro
  with multiple paths to victory and meaningful long-term planning.
