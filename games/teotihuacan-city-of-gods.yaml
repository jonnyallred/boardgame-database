# Description
description: |
  Build the great Pyramid of the Sun alongside rival civilizations in ancient Mexico.
  Players control dice-based workers that grow stronger every time they move, and must
  balance using their power now versus building it further. Each location on the circular
  board offers a choice between taking an action with a worker upgrade, or accepting a
  powerful bonus without upgrading. Construct pyramid levels, collect masks, and fulfill
  ritual requirements to score the most points when the pyramid is complete. A deeply
  strategic euro with an innovative worker-upgrade mechanism.
