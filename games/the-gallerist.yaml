  Run an art gallery in this complex economic game by Vital Lacerda. Discover
  emerging artists, commission and display their works, promote them to increase
  their value, then sell pieces to wealthy collectors for profit. Players compete
  intensely over gallery space and artist reputation, with opponents able to use
  your gallery's facilities when you're away. Balance short-term cash flow with
  long-term artist development in this rich, deeply strategic euro game.
