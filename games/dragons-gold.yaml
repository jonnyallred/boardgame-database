description: |
  Dragon's Gold is a frenetic real-time negotiation game by Bruno Faidutti where adventuring
  parties attack dragons and then must divide up the spoils — which proves far more difficult
  than slaying the beast. Each player controls a team of dragon hunters (knights, a thief, and a
  wizard), and only groups with sufficient combined strength can defeat each dragon. Once a dragon
  falls, players who participated have 30 seconds to negotiate how to split the treasure. No deal?
  Nobody gets anything. The game's brilliant tension comes from the bluffing and bartering as
  players exaggerate their contributions and make urgent trade offers under time pressure.
  Set collection drives scoring as players try to accumulate matching sets of treasure types.
  Dragon's Gold captures the chaos and comedy of loot distribution in a surprisingly short,
  highly replayable package.
