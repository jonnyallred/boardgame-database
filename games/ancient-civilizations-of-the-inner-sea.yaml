# Description
description: |
  Ancient Civilizations of the Inner Sea is a fast-playing, accessible civilization
  game from GMT Games spanning 3,500 years of Mediterranean history. Players each
  guide one of the renowned civilizations that surged and receded around the shores
  of the ancient Mediterranean — from the Egyptians and Phoenicians to the Greeks,
  Romans, and Carthaginians.

  Players compete across up to four epochs, expanding their civilizations through
  conquest, building cities and Wonders, and surviving natural disasters. The game
  uses event cards with fate mechanics — there are no dice. Card play drives combat
  and events, making it more strategic and less luck-dependent than many area control
  games.

  The game scales well from 1 to 6 players, with variable player powers for each
  civilization and a solo mode. Its accessible ruleset belies the strategic depth
  that emerges from managing limited forces across a contested map, making it a
  standout entry in GMT's catalog of historical strategy games.
