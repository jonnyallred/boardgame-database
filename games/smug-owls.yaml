# Description
description: |
  Smug Owls is a fast-paced riddle-crafting party game for 3-15 players. Each round, a
  magic deck generates a never-before-seen riddle by flipping cards from different stacks
  to form a "What is..." prompt. All players simultaneously race to come up with an answer
  to the riddle — the catch being that the last player to think of an answer becomes the
  Smug Owl (the judge) for that round. The four or more players who answered in time then
  share their answers, and the Smug Owl picks their favorite. The game plays through eight
  rounds, and the player whose answers are most frequently selected wins. Named one of the
  best games of 2023 by Polygon, Smug Owls rewards creativity, wordplay, and quick thinking.
