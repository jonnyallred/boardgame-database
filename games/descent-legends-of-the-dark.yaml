# Description
description: |
  Descent: Legends of the Dark is the third major entry in the Descent franchise, published
  by Fantasy Flight Games in 2021. Unlike its predecessors, this fully cooperative campaign
  game uses a companion app to serve as the dungeon master, replacing the Overlord player
  role and allowing all players to cooperate against the game itself. Players explore
  modular 3D dungeon tiles, fight monsters, and make narrative choices across a sprawling
  campaign set in the Terrinoth universe. Each hero has unique abilities, and characters
  develop through skill trees and equipment upgrades between sessions. The app manages
  enemy AI, story branching, and session continuity, enabling rich narrative experiences
  without a dedicated game master. The game is notable for its extraordinary production
  value, including over 40 detailed miniatures and layered 3D terrain tiles.
