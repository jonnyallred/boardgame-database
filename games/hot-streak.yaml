# Description
description: |
  Hot Streak is a raucous betting and racing party game where players take on the roles of hard-luck gamblers wagering on the world's most off-brand mascots. Before each race, players snake-draft betting tickets, predicting which mascot will finish first, second, or third, while side bets offer higher-risk payouts. Each player secretly slips one card into the communal race deck, giving them a sliver of hidden influence over the chaotic outcome. Once the bets are locked, the race runs itself — cards move mascots forward, sideways, or toppling to the ground — while everyone cheers, boos, and screams. After three escalating rounds, the player with the most winnings claims a unique life-outcome reading from the rulebook rather than a conventional victory lap.
