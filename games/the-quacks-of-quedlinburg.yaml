# Description
description: |
  As quack doctors in the medieval town of Quedlinburg, players simultaneously
  draw ingredient chips from their personal bags to brew potions. Push your
  luck by drawing more chips for a better potion, but draw too many white
  cherry bombs and your pot explodes. Between rounds, spend your earnings to
  buy powerful new ingredients that go into your bag, gradually building a
  more potent and reliable brew. Winner of the 2018 Kennerspiel des Jahres.
  A perfect gateway game that combines exciting push-your-luck tension with
  satisfying bag-building progression.
