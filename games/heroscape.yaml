description: |
  Heroscape is a pre-painted miniature wargame featuring a stunning 3D modular terrain system
  made from interlocking hexagonal tiles. Players construct custom battlefields using terrain
  pieces representing mountains, water, grasslands, and ruins, then command armies drawn from
  across time and space — from medieval knights and samurai to futuristic soldiers and dragons.
  Combat uses custom dice with skulls for attack and shields for defense. Each unit has unique
  stats and special abilities on their army cards, creating deep asymmetric gameplay. The original
  master set includes 30 pre-painted figures and 85 terrain pieces, with hundreds of expansion
  figures released over the game's lifespan. Heroscape gained a devoted following for combining
  accessible rules with rich tactical depth and spectacular table presence.
