# Description
description: |
  Tiny Towns is a spatial puzzle game for 1-6 players in which each player builds a tiny
  settlement on a personal 4x4 grid. On each turn, the active player names a resource type,
  and every player must place that resource cube anywhere on their grid. When a player arranges
  the correct pattern of resource cubes matching a building's blueprint, they remove those cubes
  and replace them with a building — but buildings can never be moved, and any cubes that cannot
  be placed are lost. The challenge is that you must accept resources even when they don't fit
  your plans, making efficiency and spatial foresight critical. Each player also chooses one
  unique Monument that scores differently, adding asymmetric objectives. The game ends when no
  player can place any more buildings, and the player with the most victory points from buildings
  and empty spaces wins. Published by AEG, Tiny Towns is praised for its elegant rules,
  satisfying spatial puzzle, and remarkably different experience at each player count.
