# Description
description: |
  Saint Petersburg (Second Edition) is a revised and expanded version of the 2004 Eurogame classic,
  funded via a successful 2014 crowdfunding campaign on the German platform Spieleschmiede. This edition
  features brand-new artwork for all cards, rebalanced card values, and includes The Market expansion
  which adds a fifth player option and a new scoring mechanism.

  As in the original, players draft cards representing Craftsmen, Buildings, Aristocrats, and Exchange
  cards. Craftsmen produce income each round, Buildings grant points or bonuses, and Aristocrats score
  based on the sets collected at game end. The fundamental tension of timing — buy early for advantage or
  wait for cards to become cheaper — remains central. The Market expansion introduces market stalls as an
  additional card type, providing new strategic paths and accommodating a fifth player. The second edition
  stands as the definitive version of one of the landmark Eurogames of the early 2000s.
