description: |
  Espresso Doppio is a stylish two-player abstract puzzle game themed around a Viennese coffee
  house. Players swap and move espresso cups, saucers, and spoons across a shared playing area
  to match their personal objective cards. Each turn, the active player makes three moves or
  exchanges to arrange the real ceramic components into matching configurations. Players hold
  eight objective cards and display three at a time, working through their deck while their
  opponent simultaneously pursues their own objectives with the same shared components.
  The game includes actual miniature espresso cups and saucers in white, brown, and black —
  a charming physical element that adds tactile appeal. A solo mode and expert variant provide
  additional challenge for dedicated fans of the coffee-themed duel.
