description: |
  Clash Royale: The Card Game is the physical tabletop adaptation of Supercell's hit mobile
  strategy game, published by Ravensburger in 2019. Players build decks of character and spell
  cards from the Clash Royale universe and battle head-to-head to destroy each other's towers.
  The game captures the lane-based push-and-pull of the mobile game, with cards representing
  troops deployed to attack opponent towers while simultaneously defending your own. Elixir
  management (the resource from the video game) translates into a card hand management system.
  The familiar cast of characters — Giants, Goblins, Princes, and other iconic Clash Royale
  fighters — brings the mobile game's strategic card-battle feel to the tabletop in a fast,
  accessible two-player format.
