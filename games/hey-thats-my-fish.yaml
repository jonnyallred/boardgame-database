description: |
  Hey, That's My Fish! is a deceptively simple abstract strategy game where 2-4 players control
  penguins on a shrinking ice floe. Each turn, a player moves one penguin in a straight line
  across hex-shaped ice tiles, then collects the tile where the penguin started — creating gaps
  that cannot be crossed in future turns. Fish on collected tiles score points, with tiles
  showing 1, 2, or 3 fish. As the board shrinks, penguins become increasingly isolated, and
  the player who collects the most fish wins. The beauty of the game lies in its elegant
  tension: moving forward to collect more fish often opens your opponent's paths while closing
  your own. A quick-playing gateway abstract that rewards spatial thinking and forward planning.
