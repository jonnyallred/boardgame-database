# Description
description: |
  The original Brass set during the Industrial Revolution in Lancashire,
  England. Players build cotton mills, canals, and rail lines across two
  eras. In the Canal Era, only connected networks score; then everything
  resets for the Rail Era with new rules and higher stakes. Hand management
  drives all decisions - each card serves double duty as a location and an
  action cost. Rawer and less forgiving than Birmingham, with a devoted
  following who prefer its sharper edges.
