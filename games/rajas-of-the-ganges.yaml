# Description
description: |
  Set in 16th century India, players take on the roles of rajas and ranis
  competing for fame and fortune in the Great Mogul Empire. A dice-driven
  worker placement game where dice serve as resources rather than randomizers.
  Players place workers on action spaces to develop provinces, trade goods
  along the Ganges, and navigate markets. The unique dual-track victory
  condition has fame and money tracks racing toward each other - the first
  player whose markers meet or cross wins.
