# Description
description: |
  Rajas of the Ganges is a dice and worker placement game set in 16th century India during
  the rise of the Great Mughal Empire. Players take the roles of powerful rajas and ranis,
  nobles racing to develop their estates into wealthy and magnificent provinces.

  On each turn, players roll a set of custom dice and place them as workers on a central
  shared board to take actions. Dice values matter: higher values unlock more powerful
  spots or provide bonus effects. Actions allow players to place tiles in their personal
  province, gain resources, or activate special bonuses.

  The game features a distinctive dual-track victory condition: players must accumulate
  both fame and money, tracked on two separate tracks that run in opposite directions
  around the outer edge of the main board. The game ends when any player's fame and money
  markers meet or pass each other, meaning a player cannot win by focusing exclusively
  on one track — balance is essential.

  Tile placement within each player's personal province creates a growing tableau of
  buildings and markets. Markets generate money income while buildings generate fame.
  Players must carefully balance these two forms of output to race their two scoring
  markers toward each other. The interplay between dice values, worker placement competition,
  and tile synergies creates a deeply satisfying Euro experience with strong replayability.
