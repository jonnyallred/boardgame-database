description: |
  Hoity Toity (Adel Verpflichtet in German) is a Spiel des Jahres 1990 winner about eccentric
  antique collectors competing to build the most impressive collection. Each round, all players
  secretly and simultaneously select a destination card: either the Auction House to bid on
  new antiques, or the Castle to display their collection and potentially steal from rivals —
  or catch thieves with the detective. This simultaneous decision creates delightful bluffing
  dilemmas as players try to predict each other's choices. Winning antiques requires both
  successful auction bidding and protecting your collection from theft. The game rewards
  reading opponents and timing bold moves, wrapped in a whimsical upper-class theme that
  perfectly captures the absurdity of high-society collecting.
