# Description
description: |
  Build train lines across the United States in a twelve-game legacy
  campaign. Each player manages their own railway company, collecting
  colored train cards to claim routes between cities. As the campaign
  progresses, frontier boxes unlock new rules, content, and surprises
  that permanently alter the game. Tickets can expire and retire into
  postcards that grant ongoing bonuses. At the end of twelve games,
  your copy becomes a unique, replayable board game. Designed by the
  creators of Pandemic Legacy and the original Ticket to Ride.
