# Description
description: |
  The Quest for El Dorado is a deck-building race game for 2-4 players designed by Reiner Knizia
  and published by Ravensburger. Players lead expeditions through a modular jungle map, using their
  card deck to move through colored terrain hexes — green jungle requires machete cards, blue water
  requires paddle cards, and yellow desert requires coin cards. Each turn, players play cards from
  their hand to move their explorer across the board, then may purchase new, more powerful cards
  to add to their deck. The first player to break through all terrain barriers and reach the golden
  city of El Dorado wins. The modular board offers over 100,000 possible layouts, and the streamlined
  deck-building mechanics make it one of the most accessible games in the genre. It was nominated
  for the 2017 Spiel des Jahres and praised for elegantly merging racing and deck building.
