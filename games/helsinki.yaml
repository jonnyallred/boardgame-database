description: |
  Helsinki is a tile-placement and open drafting game inspired by Copenhagen, set in the famous
  Senate Square of the Finnish capital. Players design pavilions across the historic square to
  protect pedestrians from rain by covering the space beneath their awnings. On each turn, players
  may draw cards into their hand (respecting a seven-card hand limit) or play cards to place
  pavilion tiles. The hand limit creates a key tension: drawing too many cards restricts options
  while playing too few leaves valuable tiles unclaimed. The grid coverage mechanic rewards
  efficient spatial planning as players compete to fill their boards with matching pavilion shapes.
  A reimagining of Copenhagen with a fresh Finnish setting and refined mechanics, Helsinki offers
  accessible family-weight Euro gameplay.
