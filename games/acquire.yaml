# Description
description: |
  In Acquire, players invest in hotel chains by strategically placing tiles on the board, founding new chains, and triggering mergers. Each turn involves placing a tile and optionally purchasing stock in available chains. When chains merge, majority and minority shareholders receive bonuses, and players must decide whether to sell, trade, or hold their stock. The game combines spatial planning with market speculation as chain values fluctuate based on size. Victory goes to the player who accumulates the most wealth through clever investments and well-timed mergers in this classic game of corporate finance.
