# Description
description: |
  Acquire is a classic economic strategy game designed by Sid Sackson in 1964,
  originally published by 3M as part of their bookshelf game series. Players take
  turns placing hotel chain tiles on a grid, founding new companies and triggering
  mergers as the board fills up.

  The core of the game is stock investment: players buy shares in hotel chains,
  and when chains merge, majority and minority stockholders receive bonuses based
  on the acquired chain's size. The funds earned from mergers can be reinvested
  into growing chains. At game's end, all chains are evaluated and the player
  with the most cash and stock value wins.

  Acquire is celebrated for its elegant simplicity — the rules are easy to learn
  but the decisions about when to invest, when to trigger mergers, and which chains
  to control create deep strategic play. It remains one of the most respected
  economic board games ever designed and has been reprinted numerous times over
  six decades.
