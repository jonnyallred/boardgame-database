# Description
description: |
  A cooperative trick-taking card game played across 50 increasingly difficult
  missions. Players must complete task cards — specific tricks that must be won
  by specific players — using only limited communication: one card revealed once
  per round. The deceptively simple rules create deep, satisfying puzzles as
  teams navigate tricky card distributions. Winner of the Kennerspiel des Jahres
  2020.
