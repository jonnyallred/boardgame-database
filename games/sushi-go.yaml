# Description
description: |
  Sushi Go! is a lightning-fast card drafting game for 2-5 players in which you pick and pass
  sushi dishes to assemble the most delicious meal. Each round, players simultaneously choose
  one card from their hand, reveal it, then pass the remaining hand to the next player. Maki
  rolls score based on who has the most; sashimi must be collected in threes; nigiri triples
  in value when paired with wasabi; and pudding cards score at the very end of the game based
  on totals across all rounds. Designed by Phil Walker-Harding and originally self-published
  in 2013 before Gamewright picked it up, Sushi Go! is one of the most accessible card drafting
  games ever made. Its friendly sushi-themed artwork, simple rules, and tight 15-20 minute
  playtime make it an ideal gateway game and family favorite.
