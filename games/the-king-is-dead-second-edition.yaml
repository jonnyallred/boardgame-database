# Description
description: |
  A game of politics and power struggles in medieval Britain. The king is dead, and three
  factions—Scottish, Welsh, and English—vie for control of the realm. Players are influential
  nobles manipulating these factions from behind the scenes, seeking to ensure their chosen
  faction dominates while securing their own influence within it.

  Each player has an identical hand of just eight action cards, which are played one at a time
  and never replenished. When you play a card, you influence one or two regions to strengthen
  a faction, then you must take a follower cube from the board, gaining influence with that
  faction while simultaneously weakening their presence on the map. This creates a unique
  tension—building your position often helps your opponents.

  Victory goes to the player with the most influence in whichever faction controls the most
  regions. With only eight actions per game, every decision matters. The game features simple
  rules but deep strategic gameplay, with significant bluffing and reading of opponents'
  intentions. The Second Edition includes updated artwork and an asymmetric variant for
  advanced play.
