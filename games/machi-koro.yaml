# Description
description: |
  Machi Koro is a fast-paced city-building dice game in which each player is
  a newly elected mayor tasked with developing a thriving city before their
  rivals. Players take turns rolling one or two dice and collecting coins from
  establishments whose activation numbers match the roll — some establishments
  activate on any player's turn, others only on your own. Coins are then spent
  to purchase new establishments from a central market, building up an
  ever-more-profitable engine, and to construct four landmark buildings that
  are the key to victory.

  Establishments are color-coded by activation type: blue cards activate on
  anyone's roll, green cards activate only on the active player's roll, red
  cards steal coins from the active player, and purple cards trigger powerful
  once-per-turn effects. The first player to complete all four of their
  landmarks wins the game.

  Originally published in Japan by Grounding, Inc. in 2012, Machi Koro went
  on to win multiple awards and was translated into over a dozen languages.
  The US edition was published by Pandasaurus Games. The game features a
  playful, colorful art style and is beloved as an approachable gateway game
  for families and new players.
