# Description
description: |
  Lead your rabbit clan to glory by drafting territory cards to claim lands
  across a 100-square kingdom grid. Build cities in fiefs, harvest resources
  like carrots and mushrooms, and complete secret parchment missions. Each
  round features simultaneous drafting and placement, with scoring based on
  multiplying city strength by resource types in each connected territory.
  Designed by Magic: The Gathering creator Richard Garfield.
