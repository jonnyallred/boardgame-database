# Description
description: |
  Bunny Kingdom is a card-drafting area-control game designed by Richard Garfield
  in which two to four bunnies compete to establish the most powerful fiefdoms
  across a 100-square grid. Over four rounds, players draft cards and use them to
  claim territories, build cities, harvest resources, and fulfill secret Parchment
  scoring objectives. Each fiefdom scores points equal to its city count multiplied
  by its distinct resource types, incentivizing both breadth and depth of
  development. Territory cards correspond directly to squares on the board, while
  Building and Parchment cards provide construction options and bonus scoring
  conditions. Drafting tension arises from balancing immediate territory grabs
  against the need to set up future scoring combos and deny opponents key cards.
