# Description
description: |
  Welcome To... is a "flip-and-write" game (sometimes called a "roll and write"
  without dice) where players simultaneously fill in a scoresheet to build their
  ideal American suburb from the 1950s. Three card combinations are revealed
  each round, each pairing a house number with a special action. Every player
  must choose one combination and write the number into a house on their street,
  keeping numbers in ascending order from left to right.

  Special actions let players build parks, pools, and picket fences, or add
  real estate agents who multiply scoring opportunities. With all players working
  simultaneously and no player interaction, Welcome To... scales effortlessly to
  any group size and can even be played via newsletter or broadcast. It's one
  of the defining gateway flip-and-write games and remains extremely popular for
  its approachability and satisfying puzzle feel.
