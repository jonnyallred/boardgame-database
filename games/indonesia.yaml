# Description
description: |
  Build an economy in the Indonesian archipelago by acquiring companies, producing
  and shipping goods, and executing mergers. Players advance along five R&D tracks
  to unlock capabilities such as larger mergers, more companies, and greater shipping
  capacity. The merger mechanism is the heart of the game, allowing any player to
  propose mergers between any companies, triggering bidding wars that can dramatically
  reshape the economic landscape. A deeply strategic economic game with no luck.
