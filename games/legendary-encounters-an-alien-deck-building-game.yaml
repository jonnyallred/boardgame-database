# Description
description: |
  A cooperative deck-building game set in the Alien film universe. Players
  take on character roles from the iconic movies, recruiting allies and
  building their decks to survive against waves of Xenomorphs. Each of the
  first four Alien films has its own scenario with unique objectives and
  enemies. Features 600 cards with original artwork. Players must cooperate
  to complete objectives and survive, but a hidden traitor mechanic can
  change the dynamic. Built on the Legendary system but redesigned as a
  fully cooperative experience.
