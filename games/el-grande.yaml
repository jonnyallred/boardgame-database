  Vie for influence across medieval Spain as Grandes competing for
  regional control. Each round, bid power cards to determine turn order
  and action selection, then deploy caballeros from your province onto
  the board. The mysterious Castillo hides secret placements revealed
  during scoring rounds. Winner of the 1996 Spiel des Jahres and
  Deutscher Spiele Preis. Widely regarded as the quintessential area
  control game.
