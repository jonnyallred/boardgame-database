description: |
  Helvetia is a production chain game set in the Swiss Alps where players manage villages that
  produce essential goods from wood and bricks to cheese and beer. Workers (literally called
  villagers) grow up to help the farm, and the game features a unique marriage mechanic where
  villagers from different players' villages can wed, creating shared bonds and obligations.
  Players build new homes, bring culture to their village, and sell goods at market. The game
  rewards building efficient production chains that convert basic resources into valuable finished
  goods. Raising livestock, cultivating fields, and expanding village infrastructure creates a
  satisfying economic simulation set against the backdrop of Alpine pastoral life.
