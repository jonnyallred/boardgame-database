# Description
description: |
  Heredity: The Book of Swan is a cooperative, narrative-driven campaign game for 1-4 players
  set in a post-apocalyptic world. Players take on the roles of a family surviving across a
  five-chapter campaign totaling 12-15 hours of total playtime. Swan is a central non-playable
  character around whom the story revolves.

  Each player character has three action tokens, and the group collectively decides in what
  order to deploy them. Rather than traditional turn-based play, the game uses a dynamic
  timeline system — a sequence of cards that evolves as actions are taken. Players can see
  upcoming events on the timeline and plan accordingly, and some actions can even reorder
  future events. Characters act by placing tokens on their body cards (head, torso, legs)
  to talk to NPCs, explore areas, move, fight, or acquire better equipment.

  A karma deck evolves throughout the campaign, influencing outcomes and multiple possible
  endings. The game delivers a branching, non-linear narrative without the need for a
  companion app. Praised for its graphic novel-style illustrations and its emotionally resonant
  storytelling, Heredity offers a refreshingly compact and accessible package for a narrative
  campaign game. Published in France by Darucat/Blackrock Games and distributed internationally
  by Asmodee.
