# Description
description: |
  Build the castle of Caylus for King Philip the Fair in medieval France.
  Place workers along the road to gather resources, construct buildings,
  and earn prestige points. The provost mechanism adds a layer of
  cutthroat interaction — players can manipulate which buildings activate
  each turn. A landmark worker placement game that helped define the
  genre. Rewards long-term planning and resource management.
