# Description
description: |
  Caylus is a seminal worker placement strategy game set in medieval France, designed by
  William Attia and first published in 2005 by Ystari Games (France) and Rio Grande Games
  (North America). Players compete to earn prestige by constructing buildings in the village
  of Caylus and contributing to the construction of the King's castle.

  The game is notable for its near-absence of random elements. The only randomness occurs
  at setup: the initial placement of six neutral buildings (yielding 720 possible starting
  configurations) and the initial turn order. Players manage five resource types — food,
  wood, cloth, stone, and gold — placing workers on buildings to gather materials, erect
  new structures, or contribute castle sections in exchange for prestige points.

  Two key mechanisms set Caylus apart: the Provost and the Bailiff. The Provost marker
  determines which workers on the road actually get to activate; players can spend money to
  push the Provost forward or back, blocking opponents or protecting their own placements.
  The Bailiff advances along the road each round, triggering castle-construction phases and
  ultimately ending the game. Controlling the pace of the Bailiff — and therefore the
  length of the game — is a central strategic lever.

  Caylus is widely credited as one of the games that defined and popularized the worker
  placement genre. It won the Deutscher Spiele Preis in 2006 and was voted the best game
  at the 2005 Essen Spiel fair by Fairplay Magazine. A card-game spin-off, Caylus Magna
  Carta, was released in 2007.
