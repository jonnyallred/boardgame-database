# Description
description: |
  Magical Athlete is a chaotic fantasy racing game in which players recruit teams
  of wildly mismatched competitors — Centaurs, Eggs, Rocket Scientists, and more
  — each with a deeply unfair, game-breaking special power. On each turn, players
  roll a die and move their chosen racer, then activate that racer's unique
  ability, which can teleport, swap positions, skip opponents, or otherwise upend
  the race entirely. Players run four separate races over the course of the game,
  earning points based on finishing position, with the highest total winning.

  The game was originally designed by Takashi Ishida and released in 2003 by
  Z-Man Games, where it became a cult classic admired for its anarchic spirit
  despite modest production values. This 2025 edition from CMYK was refined by
  Richard Garfield and features vibrant new artwork by Angela Kirkwood, along
  with 10 newly designed characters added to the original roster. The result is
  a raucous party experience driven by escalating chaos, laughter, and the
  constant threat that someone's special power will completely overturn the
  standings on the last stretch of the track.
