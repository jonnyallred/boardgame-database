description: |
  Dice Forge: Rebellion is an expansion for Dice Forge that requires the base game to play.
  Designed by Régis Bonnessée, it adds two optional modules — the Labyrinth of the Goddess
  and the Revolt of the Titans — each with alternative starting setups and new mechanics
  responding to player requests for more player interaction and combination possibilities.
  The expansion includes 120 new Heroic feat cards and new divine die faces that expand
  the custom die modification at the core of Dice Forge. Players who felt the base game
  needed more variation in the card market or more ways to interact with opponents will find
  both modules address these concerns while maintaining the elegant die-forging central mechanic.
  The two modules can also be combined for a more complex experience.
