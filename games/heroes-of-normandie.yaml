description: |
  Heroes of Normandie is a fast-paced WW2 strategy wargame inspired by Hollywood war movies.
  Two players command opposing armies — Americans versus Germans — across modular board tiles
  representing the Normandy countryside. The game uses a unique action queue system where players
  simultaneously plan their units' actions, then reveal and resolve them. Hand management of
  order cards adds tactical depth as players try to anticipate opponent moves and adapt their
  plans. Units have special abilities represented on their cards, allowing historical heroes and
  specialized troops to turn the tide of battle. The game's comic book art style and accessible
  rules make WW2 tactical combat approachable without sacrificing the strategic decisions that
  wargame enthusiasts love.
