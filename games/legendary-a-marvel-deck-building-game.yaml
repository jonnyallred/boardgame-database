# Description
description: |
  Assemble a team of Marvel heroes to take on an evil mastermind and
  their villainous scheme. Players recruit heroes from a shared pool to
  build increasingly powerful decks, generating combat strength to defeat
  villains before the mastermind's plan succeeds. Semi-cooperative with
  a shared loss condition but individual victory points. Highly expandable
  with numerous expansions.
