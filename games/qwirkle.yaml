# Description
description: |
  Qwirkle is an abstract tile-placement game in which players score points by building
  and extending lines of tiles that share a common attribute — either color or shape —
  with no duplicates allowed within a single line. The game includes 108 durable wooden
  tiles, each displaying one of six shapes (circle, square, diamond, star, clover, or
  cross) in one of six colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, or purple).

  On each turn a player places one or more tiles from their hand onto the grid, provided
  all placements extend valid lines. Every tile in every line touched scores one point.
  Completing a full line of six tiles earns a "Qwirkle" bonus of six additional points.
  Players may also exchange tiles from their hand instead of placing, then draw back up
  to six tiles. The game ends when the bag is empty and one player has played their last
  tile, earning a bonus for going out.

  Designed by Susan McKinley Ross and originally published in 2006 by MindWare, Qwirkle
  won the prestigious Spiel des Jahres (German Game of the Year) award in 2011 and has
  sold over seven million copies worldwide. Its combination of a simple ruleset, colorful
  components, and meaningful strategic decisions makes it an enduring family favorite and
  a widely recommended gateway game.
