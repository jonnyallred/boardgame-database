# Description
description: |
  The Old King's Crown is a card-driven area control game of strategy, bluffing,
  and intrigue set in an ancient, crumbling kingdom. Players take on the roles of
  rival heirs to a vacant throne, commanding one of four asymmetric factions: the
  aristocratic Nobility, the aggressive Clans, the scheming Uprising, or the
  cultish Gathering.

  Each round, players move their Herald to locations on the modular board, staking
  a claim. They then simultaneously select cards from their hand and place them
  face-down onto contested regions. When revealed, these cards trigger powerful
  effects that can eliminate opponents' cards, flank into adjacent regions, or
  alter the outcome of clashes in surprising ways. Winning regions earns influence
  and resources, while acquiring Kingdom Cards through a clever bidding system
  provides persistent effects that reshape a player's strategy.

  While all factions begin with mechanically identical starter decks, each can
  invest lore into faction-specific upgrade cards that unlock distinct playstyles
  and combo chains. The first player to reach the influence threshold for their
  player count and hold it at the end of a round wins. A robust solo mode, designed
  by Richard Wilkins (Pax Pamir 2nd Edition, Oath), is included. The Songs of Home
  expansion adds new factions and neutral Kingdom cards.
