description: |
  Castles of Mad King Ludwig is a tile-placing game where 1-4 players act as master builders
  constructing extravagant, personalized castles for the eccentric King Ludwig II of Bavaria.
  Players take turns as the Master Builder, setting prices for a selection of room tiles and
  then letting opponents buy what they want — with the Master Builder claiming whatever remains.
  Room tiles include sleeping chambers, throne rooms, gardens, hallways, and utility rooms that
  combine to fulfill secret King's Favors for bonus points. Connecting rooms in efficient layouts
  maximizes bonuses while special bonus cards reward specific combinations. The rotating Master
  Builder role creates a pricing puzzle — price rooms high enough to profit when opponents buy
  them, but risk overpaying for the remainder. Winner of the Mensa Mind Games award.
