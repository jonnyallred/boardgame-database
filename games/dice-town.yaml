# Description
description: |
  Dice Town is a Western-themed press-your-luck game designed by Antoine Bauza and Corentin
  Lebrat, published by Matagot in 2008. Players roll five custom dice — each showing playing
  card symbols (Ace through 9) — in a Yahtzee-style fashion, keeping results they want and
  rerolling others up to three times. Each die face earns specific abilities or resources:
  Aces control the bank, Kings grant gold nuggets, Queens provide property, Jacks allow
  theft, and numbered cards score at the Doc's office. Higher counts of a kept symbol beat
  competing players for that action. The game captures Wild West flavor with a charming
  cartoon art style, and its fast pace and simple rules make it accessible to families
  while the bluffing and probability decisions keep it interesting for experienced gamers.
