# Description
description: |
  Destinies is an app-driven narrative adventure game published by Lucky Duck Games in 2021.
  Players explore a richly detailed medieval fantasy world, each pursuing their own secret
  destiny objective while working within a shared story. The companion app serves as the
  game master, managing an interactive map, enemy AI, story events, and context-sensitive
  dialogue. Players examine objects by scanning them with the app's camera, uncovering
  hidden information and story branches. Dice rolls are used for skill checks and combat,
  with character abilities providing meaningful modifiers. Each scenario tells a standalone
  story with multiple branching paths and endings, offering high replayability. The game
  is praised for its immersive storytelling, beautiful miniatures, and innovative use of
  augmented reality elements through the app.
