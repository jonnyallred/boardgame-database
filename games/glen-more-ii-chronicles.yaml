# Description
description: |
  Sequel to the original Glen More, set in Scotland from medieval times
  through the 19th century. Players lead Scottish clans, selecting tiles
  from a rondel-style time track and placing them into personal territories
  to activate production chains for livestock, barley, whisky, and other
  resources. Features a unique "Chronicles" system with eight modular
  mini-expansions that can be mixed and matched across four game chapters,
  adding variety and replayability. Scoring occurs after each of four
  rounds, comparing players' whisky casks, scotsmen, landmarks, and
  persons, with penalties for having fewer than others. Emphasizes
  timing and efficiency as taking tiles further along the track costs
  valuable turns.
