# Description
description: |
  Railway Rivals is a railroad route-building game originally designed by David Watts, a
  geography teacher from Wales, and first published in 1973 by Rostherne Games. The Schmidt
  Spiele edition, published as Dampfross, won the Spiel des Jahres award in Germany in 1984
  — seven of the eight jurors ranked it first that year.

  The game is played in two distinct phases. In the building phase, players take turns drawing
  railway track directly onto the board (using washable fine-tip markers on laminated surfaces
  in early editions, or dry-erase on later boards). Each turn a player rolls dice to determine
  how much track they may lay. Building through difficult terrain such as hills and mountains
  costs additional movement, while connecting to other players' networks requires paying them
  a fee. Players earn bonuses for being the first to connect major cities to their rail network.

  In the racing phase, two cities are selected at random each round and players race trains
  along their networks between those cities. The shortest viable route on a player's own track
  wins the race and earns money. Players may also run over rival track by paying tolls, so
  having well-connected coverage is critical.

  The game was notable for its innovative use of a writable, reusable map board and its many
  interchangeable map expansions covering regions across Britain, Europe, North America, and
  Asia. The German edition Dampfross was also published by Laurin-Verlag (1992) and later
  Queen Games. A UK mass-market edition was published by Games Workshop in 1985.
