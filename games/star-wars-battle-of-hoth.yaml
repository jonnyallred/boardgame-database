# Description
description: |
  Star Wars: Battle of Hoth is a fast-paced miniatures battle board game recreating the
  iconic battle from Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back. Using the Command & Colors game
  system designed by Richard Borg, one player commands the ferocious Imperial army while
  the other leads the courageous Rebel forces on the ice planet Hoth.

  Each side has three distinct unit types: both sides field infantry, the Rebel Alliance
  commands snowspeeders and artillery turrets, while the Empire deploys probe droids and
  the dreaded AT-AT walkers. Players choose Command Cards each turn to activate units,
  then decide how to move and attack across the battlefield.

  The game includes 17 scenarios spanning the full battle, with optional Leader Cards
  featuring 6 iconic Star Wars characters. Two multi-scenario campaigns allow for extended
  play. Published by Days of Wonder and distributed by Asmodee, the game captures the
  heroic and desperate feel of the famous Hoth retreat in an accessible tactical format.
