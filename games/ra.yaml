# Description
description: |
  Bid with sun tokens across three epochs in ancient Egypt. Draw tiles
  from a bag to fill the auction track - pharaohs, civilizations, Niles,
  monuments, and gold. When Ra tiles appear or a player calls "Ra!",
  an auction begins using unique sun tokens of fixed values. Balance
  immediate needs against future bidding power. Classic Knizia auction
  design with elegant push-your-luck tension.
