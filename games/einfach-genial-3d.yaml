# Description
description: |
  Einfach Genial 3D is a 3D reimagining of Reiner Knizia's award-winning abstract
  game Ingenious (Einfach Genial). Players take turns placing colored domino-style
  hex tiles onto a compact triangular board, scoring points for each matching color
  in a straight line extending from the newly placed tile in up to five directions.
  The key scoring rule remains: a player's final score is determined by their
  lowest-scoring color, so balanced play across all six colors is essential.

  The defining innovation is vertical stacking. Tiles are physically designed so
  they cannot rest flush on a single tile beneath them — a new piece must bridge
  two existing tiles to build upward. This creates a genuine three-dimensional
  puzzle: every placement must account for both the flat scoring lines and the
  emerging topography of the board. The board is roughly one-quarter the size of
  the original Ingenious board, and players draw from a hand of five tiles (rather
  than seven), keeping the game tight and decision-dense.

  Reviewers have praised Einfach Genial 3D as the most strategically demanding
  version of the Ingenious system, offering fresh depth for fans of the original
  while remaining accessible to newcomers. A full game plays in 30–40 minutes.
