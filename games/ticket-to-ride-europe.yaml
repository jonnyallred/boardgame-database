# Description
description: |
  Ticket to Ride: Europe is a standalone expansion to the award-winning Ticket to Ride
  series, designed by Alan R. Moon and published by Days of Wonder in 2005. Players
  collect cards of various train car types and use them to claim railway routes connecting
  cities across a beautifully illustrated map of Europe.

  The Europe map introduces several new gameplay elements not found in the original:
  Tunnels add risk to mountain crossings as players must reveal extra cards; Ferries
  require locomotive wildcards to claim; and Train Stations allow players to use
  opponents' routes to complete their destination tickets. These additions give the game
  a slightly more complex and strategic feel than the base game.

  Players secretly hold destination tickets showing city pairs to connect, earning points
  for completed routes and losing points for uncompleted ones. The game plays in 30-60
  minutes for 2-5 players ages 8 and up, making it an ideal gateway game and a staple
  of family game nights worldwide.
