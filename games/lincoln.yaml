# Description
description: |
  Lincoln is a two-player card-driven strategy wargame set in the American
  Civil War, designed by Martin Wallace. Players refight the entire war at a
  strategic level in under two hours, with one player commanding the Union and
  the other the Confederacy.

  The game's signature mechanic is "deck destruction" — the inverse of deck
  building. Each side has its own asymmetric card deck reflecting the
  historical strengths and weaknesses of that faction. As the game progresses,
  players must choose which powerful cards to permanently burn (remove from
  the game) to fund actions like building units and providing leadership in
  battle, while weaker cards cycle through a discard pile that is reshuffled
  two or three times per game.

  Asymmetry is built into the game's core: the Union player always draws six
  cards per turn, and their deck grows stronger over time as they commit
  resources. The Confederate deck degrades — the Union's blockade track
  reduces the Confederate hand size from 5 down to 4 and eventually 3,
  simulating the South's declining capacity as the war drags on. There are no
  dice; all outcomes are driven by card play.

  Area movement and area control determine territorial dominance, with key
  regions of the Civil War map contested through strategic maneuvering and
  battle. The game is considered an accessible entry point into card-driven
  wargames, blending historical tension with streamlined, fast-playing
  mechanics.
