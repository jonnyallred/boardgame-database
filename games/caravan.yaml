description: |
  Caravan is a pick-up and deliver game set in the deserts of Western Africa where players trade
  goods between eight cities arranged on a 7x7 abstract grid. Each city desires a single specific
  commodity, and players compete to fulfill these demands for points. Turn order grants varying
  action counts — earlier players get fewer actions, later players more — creating a natural catch-up
  mechanism. Players can collect goods, move caravans, steal from rivals, or block routes.
  With more players, the stealing and blocking interactions intensify. The game's elegant action
  economy and competitive delivery mechanics pack surprising strategic depth into a concise playing
  time, making it an excellent midweight trading game from Rio Grande Games.
