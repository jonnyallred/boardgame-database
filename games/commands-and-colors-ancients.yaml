# Description
description: |
  An accessible tactical wargame covering ancient battles from 3000 BC to
  400 AD, primarily the Punic Wars between Rome and Carthage. Command cards
  create fog of war—cards are divided into sections (left flank, center,
  right flank), troop types, and tactics, dictating which units activate
  each turn. Includes 15 historical scenarios with accurate terrain and
  force deployment. Combat uses dice with custom symbols. Winner of the
  2006 Origins Award for Historical Board Game of the Year.
