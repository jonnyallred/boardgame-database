# Description
description: |
  Set in the historic glass-making region of the Bavarian Forest, Glass Road
  challenges players to manage resource production and building construction
  over four building periods. Using an identical hand of fifteen specialist
  cards, players simultaneously select five cards each round, attempting to
  predict opponents' choices to maximize resource collection and building
  opportunities. The innovative action selection mechanism creates tension
  between producing resources (glass, bricks, clay, etc.) and constructing
  buildings that provide processing abilities, immediate benefits, or
  end-game scoring bonuses.
