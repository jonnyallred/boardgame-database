# Description
description: |
  Attract the greatest artists and scholars to your Renaissance palazzo
  by acquiring landscapes, buildings, and freedoms through tense auctions.
  Each round pairs a competitive auction phase with individual action
  selections, as you sculpt your estate to maximize the value of completed
  works. A timeless Euro classic where auction discipline and long-term
  planning separate the princes from the pretenders.
