# Description
description: |
  Retrace Charles Darwin's historic voyage to the Galapagos Islands in this
  deep worker-placement euro. Players deploy workers who must first earn
  discipline seals before accessing advanced actions like exploration,
  specimen collection, and museum correspondence. Over five rounds, explore
  islands, dispatch findings to museums, and advance scientific theories.
  An innovative worker progression system means each worker grows in
  capability, creating satisfying engine-building arcs across the game.
