# Description
description: |
  Travel the Silk Road as Marco Polo, using dice as workers to gather
  resources, fulfill contracts, and establish trading posts across Asia.
  Each player has a unique character with a game-breaking asymmetric
  power. Roll dice each round and place them on action spaces — higher
  values are more powerful but opponents can outbid you. Winner of the
  2015 Deutscher Spiele Preis.
