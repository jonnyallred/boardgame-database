# Description
description: |
  Summoner Wars Second Edition is a fully expandable tactical dueling card game for 2 players,
  reimagining the 2009 hit with updated artwork, refined rules, and exciting new factions. Each
  player commands an asymmetric faction of fantasy warriors led by a powerful Summoner, taking
  turns moving units, attacking, and summoning new forces using a hand of faction-specific cards.
  The goal is to destroy the opponent's Summoner before yours falls. Destroyed units become
  magic energy used to fuel summoning more powerful creatures. The second edition introduces
  two great ways to play: the physical card game and the online Summoner Wars Online browser
  app, while preserving the deep tactical decisions and faction asymmetry that made the original
  a cult classic. A Master Set containing multiple factions is available as the main entry point.
