# Description
description: |
  A tactical dueling card game where two players take on the roles of powerful
  summoners battling for control of the war-torn planet of Itharia. Players
  summon units to a grid-based battlefield, maneuver them into position, and
  use dice-driven combat to destroy the opposing summoner. Each faction offers
  unique abilities and strategies, with a streamlined second edition ruleset
  and deck construction options for deep replayability.
