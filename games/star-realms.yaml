# Description
description: |
  A fast-paced space combat deck-building card game. Players start with
  identical decks and purchase ships and bases from a shared trade row
  to build powerful combos across four factions. Attack your opponent's
  authority to zero to win. Compact enough to fit in your pocket. Winner
  of multiple Golden Geek and Dice Tower awards for Best 2-Player Game.
