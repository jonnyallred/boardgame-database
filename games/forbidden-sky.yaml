# Description
description: |
  Forbidden Sky is the third game in Matt Leacock's Forbidden series, published by
  Gamewright in 2018. Players are stranded on a high-altitude storm platform and must
  cooperate to build an electrical circuit to power a rocket and escape before the
  storm destroys the platform. The game introduces a tile-laying circuit-building mechanic:
  as tiles are explored, players lay actual wire and component tokens to create a working
  electrical circuit. The circuit must be completed and connect the rocket to a power
  source before lightning tokens fill and the platform collapses. Characters have unique
  abilities, and storm events escalate the danger each round. Forbidden Sky adds a tactile
  puzzle-solving element with its physical wire-building mechanic that distinguishes it
  from the earlier Forbidden games, offering a fresh cooperative challenge with a
  satisfying climactic launch sequence.
