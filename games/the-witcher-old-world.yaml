# Description
description: |
  Set in the Witcher universe long before Geralt of Rivia, players take on the
  roles of freshly trained witchers from competing schools (Wolf, Cat, Griffin,
  Bear, Viper, or Manticore). Travel across the Continent, fight monsters, complete
  quests, and brawl with rival witchers in taverns to earn trophies. The core
  gameplay revolves around deck building where your action cards double as your
  health pool, creating tense combat decisions as every hit permanently shrinks
  your deck. First player to collect the required number of trophies wins.
