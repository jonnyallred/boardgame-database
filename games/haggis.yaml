description: |
  Haggis is an elegant climbing card game for 2-3 players that draws from the traditions of
  Zheng Fen and Big Two. Players combine elements of card combinations, bombs, scoring for
  cards in hand, and scoring for cards collected in tricks. Each player receives equally
  distributed wild cards (Jacks, Queens, and Kings) which can be used to form bombs — powerful
  combinations that beat any other play. A unique betting mechanic lets players wager that they'll
  be the first to empty their hand, adding a layer of risk and bluffing to the card play.
  Haggis rewards deep card game knowledge and sharp memory over many sessions, making it a
  beloved choice among serious card game enthusiasts who want a compact but strategically rich
  experience.
