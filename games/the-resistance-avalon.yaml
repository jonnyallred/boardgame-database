# Description
description: |
  A social deduction game set in the Arthurian legend where loyal servants
  of King Arthur must go on quests to protect the realm, while hidden
  minions of Mordred try to sabotage their efforts. Players are secretly
  assigned roles as either good or evil, then vote on team compositions
  for a series of quests. Evil players can secretly fail quests while
  good players try to deduce who the traitors are. The Avalon edition
  adds powerful character roles like Merlin (who knows the evil players),
  the Assassin (who can win by identifying Merlin), Percival, Morgana,
  Mordred, and Oberon, creating layers of hidden information and bluffing.
  A standalone reimplementation of The Resistance with a fantasy theme.
