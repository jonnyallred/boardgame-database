# Description
description: |
  Crossbows & Catapults: Fortress War is Restoration Games' 2024 revival of the beloved
  1983 classic, funded via Kickstarter with nearly $1 million in backer support. Two players
  face off in a kinetic siege battle: each builds their own castle from colorful plastic
  blocks, then takes turns launching discs at the opponent's fortifications using spring-powered
  crossbows and catapults.

  Unlike the original rubber-band-based weapons, the 2024 edition features re-engineered
  artillery pieces driven by springs and levers for more consistent and durable performance.
  The Fortress War version adds an asymmetric tactics card deck, letting players take special
  actions and recruit Mercenary miniatures with unique abilities, adding strategic variety
  to the physical challenge.

  The goal is to knock all of the opponent's regular soldiers off the field. Blocks and walls
  tumble satisfyingly with each well-aimed shot. The game emphasizes kinetic fun and nostalgia
  while the added card layer gives players meaningful choices beyond pure dexterity. Published
  in partnership with Goliath Games and released at retail in fall 2024.
