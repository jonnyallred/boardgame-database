description: |
  Forgotten Depths is a cooperative dungeon-delving game that combines tile-laying with hand
  management to deliver a quick but substantial exploration experience. Players guide a party
  of heroes down through dungeon levels to destroy the powerful entity lurking at the bottom.
  Tile placement creates the dungeon as heroes explore — each level features its own Ecology
  with unique monsters, environmental features, and hard-to-find Legendary Locations. Heroes
  grow stronger by finding and equipping items and purchasing abilities and spells with
  experience points earned through exploration. Three distinct dungeon level ecologies ensure
  significant variety across playthroughs. The game prioritizes a tight, focused dungeon
  crawl experience that plays faster than traditional dungeon crawlers without sacrificing
  meaningful character progression.
