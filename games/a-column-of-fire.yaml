# Description
description: |
  A Column of Fire is a board game adaptation of Ken Follett's third Kingsbridge
  novel, set in Elizabethan Europe where Catholics and Protestants clash for
  dominance across England, France, Spain, and the Netherlands. Players manage
  trade networks and agents across the continent, with each country's religious
  allegiance shifting as the conflict unfolds — if a country flips to the opposing
  religion from a player's trade network, that player loses access to those
  markets. Dice rolled each round determine worker hiring costs, and hired
  specialists tick down in value over subsequent turns, creating urgency to deploy
  them effectively. Players must hedge religious bets and build flexible networks
  capable of surviving the inevitable Reformation upheavals.
