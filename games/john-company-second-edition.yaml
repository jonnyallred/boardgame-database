# Description
description: |
  Players assume the roles of ambitious families attempting to leverage the
  British East India Company for personal gain. Rather than controlling the
  Company directly, players negotiate collectively over its direction while
  competing for prestige through strategic retirement timing and estate
  building during the London Season. The game engages seriously with themes
  of imperialism and globalization in the 18th and 19th centuries. The
  extensively revised second edition features a cloth map and premium
  components. Designed by Cole Wehrle with a solo mode by Richard Wilkins.
