# Description
description: |
  John Company: Second Edition is a semi-cooperative negotiation game simulating
  the internal politics and economic machinations of the British East India Company
  from roughly 1710 to 1857. Designed by Cole Wehrle and published by Wehrlegig
  Games in 2022, it is a ground-up redesign of the 2017 first edition following
  extensive playtesting and community feedback.

  Players each control a family of ambitious British aristocrats seeking to build
  personal wealth and prestige by placing family members into Company roles —
  administrators, military commanders, and merchants — while the Company itself
  must remain solvent enough to continue operations on the Indian subcontinent.
  The tension between personal enrichment and collective responsibility is central
  to the experience: players must negotiate, bribe, and bargain with one another
  to steer the Company's fate, yet each is ultimately trying to retire their family
  members with the most accumulated prestige.

  One player each round serves as the Chairman, proposing Company operations and
  calling votes; another may serve as Prime Minister, shaping legislation that can
  dramatically alter the game's rules and economy. Crises regularly erupt across
  India, requiring military responses that drain the Company's treasury and test
  diplomatic resolve among the players.

  The game covers the full arc of the Company's history through a series of
  scenarios of varying length, from shorter introductory scenarios to a full
  campaign spanning the Company's rise and fall. John Company was named one of the
  best games of 2022 by Smithsonian magazine and was nominated for four Golden
  Geek Awards including Most Innovative and Best Heavy Game.
