# Description
description: |
  Develop the French harbor town of Le Havre by collecting resources, constructing
  buildings, and building ships to score points and repay loans. On each turn,
  distribute new goods to the harbor's offer spaces, then either take all goods of
  one type or use a building for its action. Buildings may be owned by any player,
  forcing clever decisions about when to build versus use existing structures. A
  deep and rewarding economic engine game from the designer of Agricola.
