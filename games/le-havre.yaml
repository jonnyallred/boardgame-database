# Description
description: |
  In Le Havre, players take on the role of harbor masters developing the
  French port city. Each round, goods accumulate on the offer spaces. On
  your turn, either take all goods of one type from an offer space or use
  one of the available buildings. Buildings let you upgrade resources,
  sell goods, or construct new buildings and ships. Ships are essential
  for feeding your workers — a constant pressure throughout the game.
  Build the most valuable port operation through careful resource
  management and strategic building chains. The player with the most
  wealth (buildings plus cash minus loans) at the end wins.
