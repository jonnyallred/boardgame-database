# Description
description: |
  Kingdom Builder is a strategic territory-building game in which players compete
  to earn the most gold by settling the landscape of a modular kingdom. On each
  turn, a player draws a single terrain card and must place exactly three settlement
  tokens on matching terrain hexes — and always adjacent to existing settlements
  if possible. This deceptively simple placement rule drives most of the game's
  tactical tension.

  Each game uses four of eight double-sided board sections arranged randomly,
  and three of ten scoring cards are drawn to define how gold is earned — rewarding
  connected settlements, settlements adjacent to water, largest groups, or other
  goals. Players also collect special action tiles by placing next to locations
  such as castles, taverns, and oases, granting one-time or recurring powers like
  moving a token, placing an extra piece, or bypassing terrain restrictions.

  The combination of randomised boards and rotating scoring objectives gives
  Kingdom Builder exceptional replayability. It won the Spiel des Jahres award
  in 2012, with the jury praising its clever variable victory conditions and the
  way its simple building mechanic reveals deeper strategic layers after a few
  plays. The game rewards players who can read the board state, plan routes
  efficiently, and adapt their strategy to the three hidden-until-setup scoring
  criteria.
