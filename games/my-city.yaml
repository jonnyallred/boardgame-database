# Description
description: |
  My City is a legacy tile-placement game for 2-4 players designed by Reiner Knizia,
  published by KOSMOS in 2020. It earned a Spiel des Jahres nomination and was Knizia's
  first foray into legacy game design.

  Each player has their own personal board depicting a landscape split by a river, and
  a set of 24 polyomino tiles in eight different Tetris-like shapes. Play is fully
  simultaneous: each round a card is drawn from a shared deck revealing which tile shape
  everyone must place, so there is no downtime or waiting. Tiles must be placed
  adjacently on the grid, and scoring incentivizes covering trees, avoiding bare rocks,
  and building along the river's edge.

  The game unfolds across 24 episodes grouped into chapters, each introducing new rules,
  stickers, and permanent changes to individual player boards as the city grows from its
  preindustrial origins through industrialization. Decisions made in one session carry
  forward, giving each player's city a unique history. For groups who prefer non-legacy
  play, the double-sided game board includes an eternal mode for repeatable, standalone
  sessions without any permanent changes.

  The streamlined simultaneous-play format and gentle rules complexity make My City
  accessible to families and casual gamers, while the evolving challenge of fitting
  tiles into an increasingly developed and stickered board provides satisfying
  spatial puzzle-solving throughout the campaign.
