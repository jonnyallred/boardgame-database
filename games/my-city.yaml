# Description
description: |
  A family-friendly legacy game spanning 24 episodes where players develop
  their personal city boards from pre-industrial beginnings through
  industrialization. Each episode, cards are flipped and all players
  simultaneously place the matching polyomino building tile onto their
  boards, trying to cover rocks and maximize points while avoiding covering
  trees. Choices carry forward between sessions as new rules and components
  are introduced. Also includes a non-legacy mode for replay.
