# Description
description: |
  War of the Ring is an epic asymmetric wargame set in J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-
  earth during the events of The Lord of the Rings. One player controls the Free
  Peoples — Gondor, Rohan, the Elves, the North, and the Dwarves — while the
  other commands Sauron's Shadow armies. The game captures both the grand
  military conflict and the secret Fellowship mission simultaneously.

  Each round, players roll action dice that determine which types of actions
  they may take: moving armies, recruiting troops, playing event cards, or
  advancing characters. The Shadow wins by military conquest (capturing enough
  Free Peoples cities) or corrupting the Ring-bearers, while the Free Peoples
  can win militarily or by destroying the One Ring in Mount Doom. The game
  is renowned for its fidelity to the source material and its capacity to tell
  dramatic stories through play, though it demands a significant time commitment.
