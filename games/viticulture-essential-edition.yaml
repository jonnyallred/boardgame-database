# Description
description: |
  Viticulture Essential Edition is the definitive version of Stonemaier Games'
  beloved winery worker-placement game, incorporating the best elements from the
  Tuscany expansion into the base game. Players manage a Tuscan vineyard through
  the seasons — planting vines, harvesting grapes, aging wine in cellars, and
  fulfilling orders.

  The Essential Edition adds the popular Visitor cards (Summer and Winter
  visitors with unique one-time effects), the Automa solo mode, and refined
  wake-up order mechanics that let players trade going-order priority for bonus
  resources. The result is a more polished, strategically rich experience than
  the original Viticulture, with greater replayability through variable visitor
  cards and special worker options. Widely considered one of the best
  entry-level Euro games and a Stonemaier staple.
