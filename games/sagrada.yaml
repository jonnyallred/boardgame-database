# Description
description: |
  Sagrada is a dice-drafting and placement game in which players compete as
  artisans crafting the stained glass windows of the Sagrada Familia cathedral
  in Barcelona. Each player works on a personal 4x5 grid window panel, placing
  dice that represent colored glass pieces according to strict placement rules:
  no two dice of the same color or the same number may be placed orthogonally
  adjacent to each other, and each space on the window may carry a color or
  shade restriction that must be honored.

  Each round, a pool of dice is rolled and players take turns drafting one die
  to place in their window. Players may spend Favor tokens to activate Tool
  Cards that bend the normal rules in useful ways — re-rolling dice, moving
  placed pieces, or changing a die's value. At the end of ten rounds, players
  score points based on their Private Objective (favoring specific die colors
  and values), shared Public Objectives (patterns of color or shade across the
  window), remaining Favor tokens, and penalties for empty spaces.

  The game also features a solo mode in which a single player races to complete
  their window against a card-driven timer. Sagrada is praised for its
  accessibility, beautiful table presence, and the satisfying tension between
  pursuing objectives and working around placement constraints. It was included
  in Wirecutter's Best Board Games list and featured in Ars Technica's 2019
  gift guide.
