description: |
  Here to Slay is a competitive fantasy card game from the creators of Unstable Unicorns where
  players assemble a full party of six different hero classes to defeat monsters. On each turn,
  players spend action points to draw cards, play heroes, equip items, cast spells, or attack
  monsters rolled against with dice. Victory can come two ways: be the first to slay three
  monsters or assemble a complete party of six different hero types. Players can also sabotage
  rivals by playing curse cards or stealing their heroes. The game captures the chaos and fun
  of tabletop RPG adventuring in a fast, accessible card game format that rewards both strategic
  party building and opportunistic monster hunting.
