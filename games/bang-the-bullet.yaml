# Description
description: |
  BANG! The Bullet is the deluxe all-in-one edition of the classic BANG! card
  game, containing the base game plus five expansions in a stylized bullet-shaped
  tin. The Wild West hidden-role game casts three to eight players as the Sheriff,
  Deputies, Outlaws, and a Renegade — but only the Sheriff is publicly revealed
  at the start. Players use cards representing weapons and special actions to
  shoot at targets in range, with Outlaws trying to eliminate the Sheriff and
  Deputies protecting him while the Renegade waits to be the last one standing.
  Role secrecy creates constant deduction and misdirection as players try to
  identify friends and enemies. The Bullet edition debuted at Essen 2007 and
  received nominations for Best Card Game and Best Party Game at the Golden Geek
  Awards.
