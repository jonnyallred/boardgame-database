# Description
description: |
  Marvel United: Multiverse is a standalone cooperative board game and sequel to Marvel United
  (2020), published by CMON. Players take on the roles of iconic Marvel heroes working together
  to stop a powerful villain whose master plan is revealed through a unique card-driven system.

  Each villain unveils their plan through cards that trigger escalating effects and threats across
  modular locations. Heroes choose cards from their individual decks to perform actions and
  superpowers, and crucially, hero cards chain together — the card played by one hero creates
  follow-up opportunities for the next, encouraging tight teamwork and combo-building.

  Multiverse introduces the Commander Solo Mode for single-player play, new equipment cards,
  and a roster of heroes and villains spanning the wider Marvel multiverse. It is compatible
  with components from the original Marvel United and its expansions. The game features
  highly detailed miniatures and plays in approximately 40-50 minutes.
