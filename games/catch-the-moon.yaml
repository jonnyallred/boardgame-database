# Description
description: |
  Catch the Moon is a dexterity stacking game in which players cooperate
  and compete to build a delicate tower of wooden ladders reaching ever
  higher toward the moon. On each turn, a player rolls a custom die that
  dictates exactly how their ladder must be placed: touching one other
  ladder, touching two other ladders, or positioned at the very highest
  point of the current structure.

  If a ladder falls during placement, the moon "cries" — the active player
  takes a raindrop token as a penalty. When all ladders have been placed or
  all raindrop tokens have been claimed, the game ends and the player with
  the fewest raindrops wins. The game also includes rules for a fully
  cooperative variant.

  The production is charming and tactile: a solid plastic cloud base,
  wooden ladders, and a decorative moon figure combine to create an
  eye-catching table presence. Its simple rules and short playtime make it
  an excellent gateway game and a crowd-pleaser across age groups.
