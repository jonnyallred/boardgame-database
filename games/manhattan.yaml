# Description
description: |
  Manhattan is an area control game designed by Andreas Seyfarth in which 2-4 players compete
  to construct and dominate skyscrapers across six city districts on a modular board. Each player
  holds a hand of cards indicating which grid positions they may build in each city. On their turn,
  a player selects one of six building cards, chooses a target city, and places a building block
  in the corresponding grid space — either starting a new skyscraper or adding to an existing one.
  Crucially, players can stack blocks on top of each other's buildings, seizing control of a
  skyscraper simply by placing the topmost floor.

  After every player has played all six cards in a round, scoring occurs. Points are awarded for
  owning the top floor of individual buildings, controlling the majority of skyscrapers in each
  district, and possessing the single tallest building on the board. After four rounds the player
  with the most points wins.

  Manhattan won the prestigious Spiel des Jahres award in 1994, with the jury praising its
  originality and high levels of player interaction. The game is noted for its tactile three-
  dimensional board presence as skyscrapers rise across the cityscape, and for the tight tension
  that emerges from players constantly stealing control of buildings from one another. Originally
  published by Hans im Glück in Germany and later by Mayfair Games for the English-language market,
  Manhattan remains a beloved classic of the 1990s Euro wave and an accessible introduction to
  area majority mechanics.
