# Description
description: |
  Descent: Journeys in the Dark (First Edition) is a dungeon-crawl adventure game published
  by Fantasy Flight Games in 2005 in which one player takes on the role of the Overlord
  — controlling monsters and traps — while up to four other players control heroes exploring
  dangerous dungeons in search of treasure and glory. The game features modular dungeon tiles,
  detailed plastic miniatures, and a rich variety of heroes and monsters each with unique
  abilities. Combat is resolved with custom dice, and heroes gain experience and equipment
  as they complete quests. The Overlord also gains power through conquest points, creating
  an escalating arms race throughout the campaign. The game is notable for its high
  production quality, extensive component count, and the asymmetric tension between the
  cunning Overlord and the cooperative heroes.
