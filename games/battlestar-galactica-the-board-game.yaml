# Description
description: |
  Survive the journey to Kobol as humans struggle against hidden Cylon
  infiltrators. Players take on roles from the reimagined TV series,
  using skill cards to resolve crises while managing dwindling resources
  of fuel, food, morale, and population. Midway through, a second round
  of loyalty cards may reveal new traitors. Revealed Cylons operate from
  the Resurrection Ship, launching attacks and sabotaging from afar.
  The paranoia-driven social deduction and crisis resolution create
  unforgettable moments of accusation and betrayal.
