description: |
  Ghost Adventure is a cooperative dexterity game where players use a spinning top to navigate
  through haunted missions. Players stand around the table and take turns tilting interconnected
  boards to guide the spinning top along prescribed routes, marking objectives and jumping between
  board levels — all before the top stops spinning. Missions require completing a set path within
  four spins, with players coordinating their tilts to keep the top moving and on course. The
  game includes 56 different missions across eight double-sided boards showing different worlds,
  offering significant variety. Ghost Adventure is designed to be played standing, creating an
  active, physical cooperative experience unlike most tabletop games. An ideal family activity
  that combines skill, communication, and delightful chaos.
