# Description
description: |
  Distilled is a medium-weight thematic euro game in which players inherit a distillery and compete to earn the title of Master Distiller. Over seven rounds, players purchase ingredient cards, recipes, and distillery upgrades from a market, then simultaneously process their mash through a distinctive distillation mechanic — shuffling a deck, then removing the head and tail cards — to produce spirits like whisky, rum, baijiu, gin, and tequila. Aged spirits stored in barrels accumulate prestige points over time, rewarding long-term planning, while public milestones create competitive racing sub-goals. Asymmetric distiller identities give each player unique starting abilities and signature recipes, and a push-your-luck element allows failed batches to serve as catch-up opportunities. The game's mechanics integrate tightly with its distilling theme, making the system intuitive to learn despite its strategic depth.
