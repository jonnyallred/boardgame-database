# Description
description: |
  Flash Point: Fire Rescue is a cooperative firefighting game published by Indie Boards and
  Cards in 2011. Players take on specialized roles — Cadet, Driver/Operator, Paramedic,
  Rescue Specialist, and others — each with unique action abilities, working together to
  rescue survivors from a burning building before it is consumed by flames. Each turn,
  players spend action points to move through the building, clear smoke, chop through walls,
  fight fires, and carry victims to safety. After each player's turn, the fire spreads
  through a dice-driven mechanism that can cause explosions and structural damage. Players
  lose if the building collapses or too many victims perish. The game features two difficulty
  modes (family and expert), making it accessible to new cooperative gamers. It is frequently
  praised as an excellent entry-level cooperative game with real tension.
