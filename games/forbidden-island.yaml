# Description
description: |
  Forbidden Island is a cooperative tile-based adventure game designed by Matt Leacock
  and published by Gamewright in 2010. Players work together as a team of adventurers
  collecting four sacred treasures from a sinking island before it floods completely.
  Each turn, players take up to three actions — moving, shoring up flooded tiles, trading
  treasure cards, or capturing a treasure — and then draw cards that may flood or sink
  island tiles. Special role cards grant each player unique abilities to help the team
  survive. The island sinks progressively as cards are drawn, and players lose if any
  treasure location sinks before its treasure is captured, or if the helicopter pad or
  certain key tiles are lost. Forbidden Island is celebrated as an excellent introductory
  cooperative game: quick, tense, and accessible to players of all ages. It introduced
  many gamers to the cooperative genre.
