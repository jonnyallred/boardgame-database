description: |
  Himalaya is a pick-up and deliver game set in the Himalayan mountains where players control
  caravans trading goods between villages. The game uses a programmed movement system where
  players simultaneously plan their actions before revealing and resolving them. Players must
  balance gathering resources, fulfilling contracts, and establishing trade routes across the
  mountain terrain. An abstract strategic element overlays the delivery mechanics, requiring
  players to think several turns ahead as their programmed moves interact with opponents'.
  The combination of logistical planning with the beautiful Himalayan theme and competitive
  contract fulfillment creates a distinctive Euro experience from French publisher Tilsit.
