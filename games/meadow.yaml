# Description
description: |
  Meadow is a nature-themed card drafting and set collection game for 1-4 players in which
  participants take the role of wanderers observing the natural world. Players stroll through
  picturesque surroundings, collecting ground cards (animal life habitats), observation cards
  (specific plants and animals), landscape cards, and discovery cards to build their personal
  meadow tableau.

  On each turn a player selects a card from a central board arranged by cardinal directions
  (North, South, East, West decks), then plays a card from their hand onto one of their tableau
  columns. Cards cascade in columns, with only the topmost card's icons remaining active as
  prerequisites for future placements. Path tokens limit access to card slots, creating a
  worker-placement-like tension as the round progresses.

  The game features 184 cards illustrated in stunning hand-painted watercolors by Karolina Kijak,
  each depicting a real species or landscape. Players score points for observed species, fulfilled
  landscape objectives, and souvenirs collected during their journey. The player who best captures
  the richness of nature and accumulates the most points wins the title of keenest nature observer.
  Meadow is widely praised for stimulating genuine curiosity about the natural world while
  delivering satisfying strategic depth through its card interaction systems.
