  Doom: The Boardgame translates the iconic first-person shooter into a 2-4 player dungeon
  crawl experience. One player controls the demonic Invaders while one to three other players
  each command a space marine. Marines must reach the exit to win, while the Invader player
  earns frags by killing marines — the first to six frags wins for the Invader team. Modular
  map tiles create varied dungeon layouts across multiple included scenarios. Marine players
  choose from different character classes with unique weapons and health values, while the
  Invader commands imps, demons, and cacodemons from the classic game. Custom dice determine
  combat outcomes, and the marines must manage limited ammunition carefully. Released in 2004,
  it was the top-selling board game of that year, praised for faithfully capturing the
  pulse-pounding chaos of the video game.
