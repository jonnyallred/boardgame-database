# Description
description: |
  Set in 1761 Japan at Himeji Castle, the great white fortress of Harima
  Province. Players lead rival clans vying for the favor of Daimyo Sakai
  Tadazumi, one of the most prominent advisors of the Edo Shogunate.
  Over three rounds, draft dice from a shared pool to place workers in
  the castle gardens, defend the fortress, or climb the social ladder
  of the nobility. Each die's value determines which actions are available
  and how powerful they are. Manage resources, build your court tableau,
  and time your moves to accumulate the most influence and victory points.
