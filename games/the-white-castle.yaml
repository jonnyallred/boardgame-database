# Description
description: |
  A dice-worker placement game set in feudal Japan at Himeji Castle. Draft dice
  to deploy workers into three castle areas — gardens, bridge, and inner chambers
  — each generating different actions and scoring opportunities. Manage resources
  carefully to train lantern bearers, perform ceremonies, and advance samurai retainers.
  Elegant, fast-playing, and visually striking, it distills worker placement to its
  essential decisions in a tight 60-80 minute package.
