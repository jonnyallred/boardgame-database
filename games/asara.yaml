# Description
description: |
  Asara challenges two to four rival architects to build the tallest towers for
  the Caliph of the legendary city of Asara. Players hold a hand of colored
  cards, playing one per turn to claim an action space — acquiring tower pieces,
  earning money, or assembling tower sections. Each tower requires a base and top
  at minimum, with optional windows, shields, and middle sections adding height
  and points. The game runs over four rounds with scoring each year for tower
  count and ornamentation, plus a final tally rewarding the tallest towers of
  each color and overall. The color-locking rule (you can only add to a tower
  in the color of the card you played) creates interesting hand management tension.
  Nominated for the 2011 Spiel des Jahres, Asara is an accessible family game
  with genuine strategic teeth.
