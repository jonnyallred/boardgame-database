# Archive

Snapshot of the project data before the BGG dependency removal (February 2026).

## Contents

- `games-v1/` — Copy of all 389 `games/*.yaml` files at time of archival
- `master-list-v1.yaml` — The original `master_list.yaml` (BGG Top 1000 with `bgg_rank` field)

## Why

The project was restructured to remove all BoardGameGeek dependencies and build
a new master list from alternative public sources (award lists, Wikipedia, publisher
catalogs). This archive preserves the original data for reference and comparison.
