# Description
description: |
  Lead a caravan along the golem road, trading and upgrading crystals to
  fulfill golem contracts for victory points. Each turn, choose one of
  four actions: acquire a trade route card, play cards to gain or convert
  crystals, claim a golem card, or rest to reclaim played cards. A
  re-themed version of Century: Spice Road with gorgeous fantasy art.
  Simple to learn with satisfying engine-building depth.
