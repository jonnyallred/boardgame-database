# Description
description: |
  As a commodore of a small Space Base, draft new ships into your fleet
  to work and patrol the 12 sectors under your watch. On your turn, roll
  two dice and choose to use them individually or as a sum to activate
  corresponding ship sectors, earning credits, income, or influence
  (victory points). A key twist: when other players roll, your deployed
  (flipped) cards also activate, keeping everyone engaged on every turn.
  Build an engine of ships that generate rewards both on your turn and
  others'. First to 40 points wins promotion to Admiral.
