# Description
description: |
  A fast-paced two-player trading game set in the markets of Rajasthan.
  Players are rival merchants competing to become the Maharaja's personal
  trader. Collect and exchange goods — leather, spice, cloth, silver, gold,
  and diamonds — selling sets for bonus tokens. Camels serve as a flexible
  trade currency but must be managed carefully. The tension lies in deciding
  when to collect more goods versus selling early for the best bonus chips.
  Best of three rounds determines the winner.
