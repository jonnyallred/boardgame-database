# Description
description: |
  Take on the role of a gallerist in the contemporary art world. Discover
  and promote artists, buy and display their works, hire assistants, conduct
  media campaigns, and attract international visitors to your gallery.
  Each location on the board offers two actions, and displacing another
  player's gallerist grants them a bonus executive action. Manage your
  influence, reputation, and finances across four interconnected action
  spaces to become the most prestigious gallery owner.
