  Updated second edition of the Kennerspiel des Jahres winner. Draft cards
  across three ages to build your ancient civilization and its Wonder of

  neighbor. Develop commerce, science, military, and civic structures.
  Features updated artwork, streamlined rules, and improved iconography
  over the original 2010 edition. Scales remarkably well from 3 to 7
  players with minimal increase in play time.
