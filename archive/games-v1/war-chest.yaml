# Description
description: |
  An all-new bag-building war game where players draft military units
  into their armies, then draw unit coins from their bag each round to
  deploy and maneuver forces on a hex-grid battlefield. Each coin can
  be used for multiple action types: deploy, move, attack, control,
  bolster, or pass. The first player or team to place all their control
  markers wins. Combines the tactical depth of abstract strategy games
  with the variability of bag building. Supports 1v1 or 2v2 team play.
