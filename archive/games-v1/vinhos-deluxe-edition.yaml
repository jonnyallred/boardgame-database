# Description
description: |
  A strategic economic game about Portuguese winemaking by Vital Lacerda.
  Players develop estates with vineyards and wineries across regions of
  Portugal over six years, hiring enologists and farmers to produce the
  finest wines. Actions are selected from the Quadrel, a three-by-three
  grid where movement costs increase with distance. Score points by
  selling wine domestically, exporting overseas, and showcasing at wine
  fairs. The Deluxe Edition features a double-sided board with both the
  original 2010 Reserve rules and the streamlined 2016 Special Vintage.
