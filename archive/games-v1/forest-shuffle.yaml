# Description
description: |
  Build the most ecologically diverse forest by playing tree and animal
  cards into your tableau. On each turn, either draw two cards from the
  deck or clearing, or play a card by paying its cost in discarded cards.
  Animals attach to specific sides of tree cards, creating symbiotic
  combinations and end-game scoring bonuses. The game ends when the
  third winter card is drawn from the deck.
