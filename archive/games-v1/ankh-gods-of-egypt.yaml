# Description
description: |
  Players embody Egyptian gods competing for supremacy as ancient Egypt
  begins to forget the old ways. Gain Devotion through controlling
  monuments, winning conflicts, and playing cards. The action track creates
  a unique flow where timing of events depends on player choices. Standout
  merging mechanic: when a god falls behind, they merge with another player,
  combining forces. Highly detailed miniatures and asymmetric god powers.
  Completes Eric Lang's mythological trilogy alongside Blood Rage and
  Rising Sun.
