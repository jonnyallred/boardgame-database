# Description
description: |
  Crack a secret code by querying analog punch card verifiers that provide
  true or false responses to your guesses. Each round you propose a three-digit
  code and choose which verifiers to check, trying to deduce the answer in
  fewer queries than your opponents. A remarkable achievement in analog
  computing that generates millions of unique puzzles without electronics.
