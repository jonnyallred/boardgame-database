# Description
description: |
  A cooperative Lovecraftian horror game where investigators attempt to disrupt
  the summoning ritual of an Elder One and then defeat it in combat. Players
  must strategically embrace insanity, gaining powerful abilities as they lose
  their minds. Each scenario features a unique Elder One with distinct mechanics
  and a modular map that changes every game. Designed by Rob Daviau and Eric
  Lang with lavishly detailed CMON miniatures.
