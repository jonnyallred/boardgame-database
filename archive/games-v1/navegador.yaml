# Description
description: |
  Set during Portugal's Age of Discovery in the 15th-16th centuries, players build a colonial empire through exploration, colonization, and trade. The game features Mac Gerdts' innovative rondel action selection system where players move their marker around a circular board to choose actions: sailing to discover new regions, hiring workers, founding colonies, trading goods on the market, constructing buildings and ships, or gaining privileges. Players sail the seas to explore unknown territories, establish colonies producing sugar, gold, and spices, and build factories to process goods. Success comes from balancing exploration rewards, colony production, market prices, and privileges to become the most prosperous dynasty by game end.
