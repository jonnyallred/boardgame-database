# Description
description: |
  Two rival spymasters know the secret identities of 25 agents. Their
  teammates know the agents only by codename. Spymasters give one-word
  clues that can point to multiple words on the board. Teams race to
  identify all their agents while avoiding the assassin. Winner of the
  2016 Spiel des Jahres. Simple rules with surprising depth in clue
  construction.
