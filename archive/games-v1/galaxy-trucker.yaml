# Description
description: |
  Frantically grab tiles in real-time to build a spaceship, then watch in
  horror as meteors, pirates, and cosmic hazards tear it apart during the
  flight phase. The joy comes from the chaos rather than winning, as even
  well-built ships can suffer catastrophic failures. A unique blend of
  real-time building and comedic destruction by Vlaada Chvátil.
