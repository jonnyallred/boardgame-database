# Description
description: |
  A fast-paced tactical bicycle racing game where each player controls
  a team of two riders: a Rouleur (endurance) and a Sprinteur (burst
  speed). Players simultaneously select cards from each rider's unique
  deck to determine movement, depleting their deck as they go.
  Slipstreaming and exhaustion mechanics create dynamic pack racing.
  The modular track allows varied courses with hills and terrain.
