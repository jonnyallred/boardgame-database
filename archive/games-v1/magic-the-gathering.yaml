# Description
description: |
  The original collectible card game. Build a deck of spells, creatures,
  and lands, then duel opponents in magical combat. Each player starts
  with a library of cards and 20 life points. Tap lands for mana to cast
  spells, summon creatures, and deploy enchantments and artifacts.
  Strategic deck construction combines with tactical in-game decisions.
  Created by Richard Garfield and published by Wizards of the Coast in
  1993, it launched an entire genre and remains the most popular CCG
  in the world.
