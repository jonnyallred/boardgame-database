# Description
description: |
  A story-driven cooperative survival and exploration game set in a dark
  world blending Arthurian legends and Celtic mythology. Players navigate
  a dying island of Avalon through branching narrative encounters using
  a diceless card-based combat and diplomacy system. Character development
  along opposing trait axes creates meaningful deck-building decisions.
  Features a 200+ page Exploration Journal and 760+ cards across a
  multi-chapter campaign spanning 30-50 hours.
