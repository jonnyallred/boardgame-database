# Description
description: |
  In a post-apocalyptic frozen world, rival tribes emerge from underground
  to reclaim the surface. Expand across a modular hex map by populating
  locations, building structures, and progressing along tech tracks.
  Multi-use cards drive your actions - play them to different slots for
  different powers - while deck building lets you acquire stronger cards
  over time. Features asymmetric faction abilities, a 5-part campaign
  that unlocks new content, and deeply interwoven engine-building systems.
