# Description
description: |
  Create an RPG character by drafting dice and placing them into your
  attribute grid, buying skills, collecting armor, and aligning with
  your class goals. Each die placement is a satisfying puzzle of color
  matching, value optimization, and meeting attribute thresholds. The
  adventure is in the character creation itself, turning the pre-game
  ritual into the whole game.
