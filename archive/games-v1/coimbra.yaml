# Description
description: |
  Set in 15th-16th century Portugal during the Age of Discovery, players
  represent heads of influential Coimbra houses seeking prestige. An
  innovative dice drafting mechanism lets each drafted die serve multiple
  purposes -- determining turn order, influencing cost and income, and
  advancing on monastery tracks. Build relationships with citizens and
  optimize synergies across multiple scoring dimensions.
