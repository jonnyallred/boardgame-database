# Description
description: |
  Collect and combine origami-style sea creature cards in this quick set
  collection game with a push-your-luck twist. On each turn, draw cards
  from the deck or discard piles, play combos for special effects, and
  decide whether to end the round or give opponents one extra turn to
  close the gap. Beautiful card art evokes the ocean through paper craft.
