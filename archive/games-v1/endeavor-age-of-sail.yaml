# Description
description: |
  Build a maritime empire during the Age of Sail by expanding across
  trade routes and discovering new lands. Develop your civilization
  through four tracks - industry, culture, finance, and influence -
  each unlocking powerful buildings and actions. Draft buildings from
  a shared market, occupy cities across regions, and establish shipping
  routes to gain glory. A streamlined civilization-building Euro with
  an elegant action economy and satisfying engine growth. Reimplemented
  from the 2009 original Endeavor with upgraded components and artwork.
