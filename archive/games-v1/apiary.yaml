# Description
description: |
  Command a faction of spacefaring bees exploring the galaxy to gather
  resources, research technology, and build a thriving hive. Workers
  grow stronger with each use until they hibernate, creating a compelling
  cycle of escalating power and planned retirement. A unique worker
  placement euro with stunning art and a delightfully odd theme.
