# Description
description: |
  Compete as alchemists mixing ingredients to discover their hidden
  properties using a companion smartphone app. Combine deduction logic
  with worker placement as you gather ingredients, brew potions, sell
  to adventurers, and publish (or bluff) academic theories. Bid for
  turn order, manage limited actions each round, and debunk rival
  theories to earn the most reputation over six rounds.
