# Description
description: |
  A card-driven wargame covering tactical infantry combat in the
  European Theater of World War II. One player commands Axis forces
  while the other leads the Allies, using Fate cards to activate units,
  trigger random events, and resolve combat on hex maps. Victory is
  determined by controlling objectives and destroying enemy units.
  Acclaimed for its narrative tension and variable turn structure.
