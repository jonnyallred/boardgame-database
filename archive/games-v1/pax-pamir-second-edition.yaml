# Description
description: |
  Set in 19th century Afghanistan during the decline of the Durrani Empire,
  players take on the roles of Afghan leaders navigating the political
  landscape as the British, Russian, and Afghan coalitions vie for control
  of the region. Players purchase cards from a shared market to build their
  court of political allies, leverage these allies to tax, build roads, move
  armies, and betray one another. Dominance checks throughout the game
  determine scoring based on which coalition controls the most regions,
  creating a tense, shifting web of alliances and betrayals. The lavish
  second edition features a cloth map, custom resin pieces, and premium
  cards.
