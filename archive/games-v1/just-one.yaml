# Description
description: |
  Cooperative party word game and 2019 Spiel des Jahres winner. One player
  must guess a mystery word using one-word clues written simultaneously by
  the other players - but any duplicate clues are removed before the guesser
  sees them. Think carefully to give a helpful clue that nobody else will
  write. Play through 13 cards and try to guess as many as possible.
