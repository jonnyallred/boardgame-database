  Lead a Viking clan to glory in this worker placement game with dice-driven
  combat. Place workers to gather resources, recruit warriors, and fight
  trolls, draugr, and mythological Norse beasts threatening the harbor town
  of Midgard. Assign dice-warriors to battle monsters for glory points.
  Manage blame from undefeated creatures while completing destiny cards and
  earning favor of the gods. The champion with the most glory becomes Jarl.
