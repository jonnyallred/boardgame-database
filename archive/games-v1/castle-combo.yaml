# Description
description: |
  Draft villagers and nobles to build a 3x3 tableau of castle inhabitants,
  where card placement and adjacency determine scoring combos. Players
  spend coins to recruit characters from upper and lower city markets,
  using a messenger pawn and keys to manipulate which cards are available.
  A quick-playing filler with surprising strategic depth for its playtime.
