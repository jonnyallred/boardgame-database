# Description
description: |
  Build a kingdom by drafting and placing domino-like landscape tiles into
  a 5x5 grid. Each tile has two terrain types, and scoring is based on
  connected regions multiplied by the crowns they contain. The clever
  drafting mechanism ties tile selection order to turn order, forcing
  tough choices between powerful tiles and going first next round.
