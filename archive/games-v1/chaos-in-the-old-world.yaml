# Description
description: |
  Four Ruinous Powers of Chaos vie for supremacy over the Old World in
  this asymmetric area control game set in the Warhammer Fantasy universe.
  Each god - Khorne, Nurgle, Tzeentch, and Slaanesh - plays fundamentally
  differently, with unique powers, cultists, warriors, and upgrade cards.
  Players summon followers, play chaos cards, and battle for domination of
  key regions. Victory comes either by advancing your threat dial through
  corruption and domination, or by accumulating the most victory points.
  The asymmetry creates a deeply strategic experience where each god must
  leverage their strengths while disrupting rivals' plans.
