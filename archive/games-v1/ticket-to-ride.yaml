# Description
description: |
  Collect train cards and claim railway routes across a map of the United
  States, connecting cities to complete secret destination tickets for
  bonus points. Simple enough to learn in minutes but offers meaningful
  decisions about when to collect cards versus claim routes before opponents
  block them. Winner of the 2004 Spiel des Jahres and one of the most
  successful gateway games ever published.
