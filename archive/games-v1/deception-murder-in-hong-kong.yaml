# Description
description: |
  A social deduction game set as a murder investigation where players
  take on secret roles: Forensic Scientist, Investigators, Murderer,
  and optionally a Witness or Accomplice. The Forensic Scientist knows
  the solution but can only communicate through abstract scene tiles,
  while investigators debate which clue card and means card identify
  the murder weapon and key evidence. The murderer hides in plain sight,
  attempting to mislead.
