# Description
description: |
  Draft cards over four rounds to build your empire engine. Each round,
  players simultaneously draft seven cards, then decide which to slate
  for construction and which to recycle for immediate resources. Produce
  resources in a fixed order, chaining production across completed
  projects. The player with the most victory points at the end of round
  four wins. Fast-playing engine builder with satisfying combo potential.
