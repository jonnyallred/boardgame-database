# Description
description: |
  An abstract strategy game and the fifth entry in the GIPF Project series.
  Players place and move rings on a hexagonal board, flipping markers from
  white to black as rings pass over them. Form a row of five markers in
  your color to score, but you must sacrifice a ring each time -- reducing
  your options. The tension between building rows and losing mobility
  creates a deeply tactical experience.
