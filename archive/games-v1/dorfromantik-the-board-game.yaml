  A cooperative tile-laying game based on the popular video game, where players
  work together to build an idyllic countryside landscape using hexagonal tiles
  depicting forests, fields, villages, rivers, and railroads. Complete task tiles
  by grouping matching terrain types to score points, and progress through a
  campaign that unlocks new tile types and achievements over multiple sessions.
  Winner of the 2023 Spiel des Jahres.
