# Description
description: |
  Recreate the decisive 1600 battle that unified Japan under the Tokugawa
  shogunate. One player commands Ishida Mitsunari defending a child heir,
  the other plays Tokugawa Ieyasu seeking control. Wooden blocks hide unit
  identities, and cards represent clan loyalties rather than dice deciding
  combat. Armies without matching loyalty cards won't fight, making bluff
  and commitment timing critical. A landmark block wargame with elegant
  card-driven mechanics and no dice.
