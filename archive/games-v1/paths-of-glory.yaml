# Description
description: |
  A card-driven grand strategy wargame covering World War I from 1914 to
  1918. One player commands the Central Powers while the other leads the
  Entente, maneuvering armies across a point-to-point map of Europe and
  the Middle East. Each card can be used for operational movement, strategic
  events, or replacement points, forcing agonizing decisions every turn.
  Widely regarded as one of the finest wargames ever designed.
