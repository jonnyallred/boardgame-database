# Description
description: |
  A standalone sequel to Scythe set in 1920s Siberia following a meteorite crash
  near the Tunguska River. Players lead expeditions exploring mysterious locations,
  defeating corruption using dieselpunk mechs and gaining unique worker abilities.
  Play cards to build an engine of power and guile, enhance mechs with items and
  meteorites, and vanquish supernatural threats across modular hex tiles. Features
  entirely different mechanics from Scythe while maintaining the alternate-history
  atmosphere and stunning artwork.
