# Description
description: |
  Bet on five quirky camels as they race and stack on top of each other
  around a pyramid track. Shake the iconic cardboard pyramid to release a
  die, place desert tiles to manipulate the race, or bet on leg winners and
  the overall race outcome. Camels that land on occupied spaces stack on
  top, carrying or being carried by other camels. This second edition adds
  rogue camels running in the opposite direction. Winner of the 2014 Spiel
  des Jahres (original edition).
