# Description
description: |
  Rival mages compete to claim places of power and ancient monuments.
  Each player drafts a personal deck of just 8 artifact cards, then
  uses those artifacts to collect and convert magical essences into
  victory points. With a tight card pool and multiple paths to victory,
  every decision matters. Designed by Tom Lehmann (Race for the Galaxy).
