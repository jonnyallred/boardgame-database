# Description
description: |
  Compete to be the first to build two cities in the ancient Greek Cyclades
  islands by winning the favor of the gods through auctions. Each round,
  players bid on five Greek gods who grant different abilities -- Ares for
  armies, Poseidon for fleets, Zeus for priests, Athena for philosophers,
  and Apollo for income. Mythological creatures like the Kraken and Minotaur
  can be recruited for devastating one-time effects. A unique blend of
  Euro-style auctions with area control and conflict.
