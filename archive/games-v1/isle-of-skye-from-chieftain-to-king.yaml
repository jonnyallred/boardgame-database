# Description
description: |
  Build your Scottish clan territory by buying and placing landscape tiles
  in a clever price-setting auction. Set prices on your tiles each round,
  hoping opponents buy the ones you want to sell while leaving the ones
  you need. Variable scoring tiles change what matters each game, keeping
  strategies fresh across plays.
