# Description
description: |
  Trade spices along the Silk Road as a caravan leader in this elegant
  card-driven engine builder. Each turn, acquire merchant cards to build
  your trading deck, play cards to collect and upgrade spice cubes, fulfill
  demand contracts for victory points, or rest to reclaim your played cards.
  The game ends when a player claims their fifth point card, making timing
  crucial. First in the Century series, compatible with Eastern Wonders and
  A New World for combined play.
