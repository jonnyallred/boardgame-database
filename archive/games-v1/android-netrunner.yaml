# Description
description: |
  Asymmetric two-player Living Card Game set in the Android cyberpunk
  universe. One player is a megacorporation protecting secret agendas
  behind layers of ice; the other is a runner hacking into corporate
  servers. Bluffing and hidden information drive every decision as
  the Corp installs cards facedown and the Runner must decide which
  servers to attack. Based on Richard Garfield's 1996 Netrunner CCG,
  reimplemented by Fantasy Flight Games as an LCG format.
