# Description
description: |
  Play as Renaissance bankers in Europe from 1460-1530, financing rulers,
  sponsoring voyages, and manipulating secret organizations. Choose from four
  victory paths: imperialism, trade globalization, religious totalitarianism,
  or artistic enlightenment. Buy cards from eastern and western markets where
  prices shift based on player actions, then play them to your tableau to
  take actions, wage war, fund pirates, or start crusades. This 2nd edition
  includes expanded rules, updated components, Renaissance-inspired art, and
  incorporates all previous expansion and promo cards into the core game.
