# Description
description: |
  A standalone entry in the Star Realms deck-building series that adds
  cooperative and solo challenge modes alongside the classic head-to-head
  format. Acquire powerful ships and bases from a shared trade row to
  build a combat deck and reduce your opponent's authority to zero. Fast,
  portable, and endlessly replayable.
