# Description
description: |
  A cooperative nightmare-horror board game where players build a settlement
  of survivors in a world of darkness and monsters. Each campaign spans
  multiple Lantern Years - hunt terrifying creatures, craft gear from their
  remains on a unique 3x3 gear grid, and develop your civilization against
  escalating threats. Combines tactical monster showdowns with strategic
  settlement management. Features premium miniatures and a deeply thematic
  narrative driven by AI decks, hit location systems, and story events.
