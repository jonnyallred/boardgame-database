# Description
description: |
  Based on the award-winning video game, This War of Mine puts players in
  control of a group of civilians trapped in a besieged city during a modern
  armed conflict. Scavenge for food, medicine, and materials during dangerous
  nighttime raids. Make gut-wrenching moral decisions that affect your
  survivors' physical and emotional well-being. Manage your crumbling shelter,
  craft essential items, and try to endure until a ceasefire is declared.
  Driven by a massive Book of Scripts with branching narrative paths, every
  playthrough tells a different story of survival, sacrifice, and the human
  cost of war.
