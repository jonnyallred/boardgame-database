# Description
description: |
  Control a galactic empire and compete to expand your fleets and colonize
  planets through innovative dice-rolling mechanics. The number of dice you
  roll is determined by the strength of your galaxy, with each die showing
  actions like moving ships, gaining resources, or advancing influence on
  planets. Opponents can follow your actions by spending resources, keeping
  everyone engaged even during others' turns. Colonized planets grant special
  abilities and victory points in this compact 4X experience.
