# Description
description: |
  Build a galactic civilization by playing cards representing worlds and
  developments. Each round, players simultaneously choose from five
  possible actions (Explore, Develop, Settle, Consume, Produce), but
  only chosen actions occur. Cards serve triple duty as currency, trade
  goods, and tableau elements. Dense iconography replaces text, creating
  a steep initial learning curve that rewards repeated play with fast,
  deep sessions.
