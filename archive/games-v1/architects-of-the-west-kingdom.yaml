# Description
description: |
  Set at the end of the Carolingian Empire, circa 850 AD, players compete as
  royal architects to impress the King by constructing landmarks throughout
  his domain. Collect raw materials, hire apprentices, and manage your
  workforce — but beware, as rival architects can capture your workers.
  A unique twist on worker placement where placing more workers in a spot
  increases your reward, but also your vulnerability. Moral choices along
  the virtue track add strategic tension, as only at game's end will your
  virtue be judged.
