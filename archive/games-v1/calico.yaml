# Description
description: |
  Design the coziest quilt by selecting and placing hexagonal patch tiles of
  different colors and patterns onto your personal quilt board. Score points
  three ways: arrange colors into groups to earn buttons, complete specific
  pattern combinations to attract cats, and fulfill your three unique quilt
  patterns. Simple rules hide a devilishly tricky spatial puzzle as you try
  to satisfy overlapping scoring conditions simultaneously.
