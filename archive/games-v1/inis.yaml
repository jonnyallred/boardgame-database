# Description
description: |
  Celtic-themed area control game where clans vie for dominance of a
  mythical island. Draft action cards each round, then play them to
  move clans, build citadels, and trigger epic tales. Three paths to
  victory: be chieftain of territories containing six or more opponent
  clans, be present in six or more territories, or be present in
  territories containing six or more sanctuaries. Elegant card drafting
  meets tense negotiation and direct conflict.
