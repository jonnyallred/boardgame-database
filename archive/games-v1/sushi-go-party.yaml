# Description
description: |
  An expanded version of the hit card-drafting game Sushi Go! where
  players pass hands of cards around the table, selecting one each
  time to build scoring combos of sushi dishes. The Party edition adds
  a menu of over twenty different dish types, allowing players to
  customize each game's card mix. Supports up to eight players and
  plays over three quick rounds. Excellent gateway game with surprising
  strategic depth for its weight.
