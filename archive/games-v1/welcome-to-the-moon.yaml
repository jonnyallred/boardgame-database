# Description
description: |
  The final chapter of the Welcome To... trilogy, Welcome to the Moon is a
  flip-and-write campaign game where players plan humanity's escape from
  Earth and journey to the Moon. Each turn, three pairs of starship numbers
  and actions are revealed from shared card stacks, and all players
  simultaneously choose one combination to fill spaces on their adventure
  sheets in numerical order. The game features eight distinct adventure
  sheets with increasing difficulty that form a connected narrative campaign,
  with choices in earlier adventures affecting later ones. Can also be played
  as standalone sessions on any individual adventure sheet.
