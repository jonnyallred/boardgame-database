# Description
description: |
  A two-player standalone game set in the Splendor universe. Collect gems
  from a shared board, reserve and purchase development cards, and earn
  prestige points. Three ways to win: reach 20 prestige, collect 10 crowns,
  or gather prestige from cards of all five colors. More interactive and
  tense than the original, with a spatial gem-selection mechanism and
  royal cards that add strategic depth.
