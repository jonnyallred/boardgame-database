# Description
description: |
  A two-player perfect information abstract strategy game set in a martial arts
  temple. On a 5x5 board, each player controls a Master and four Students, using
  movement cards that rotate between players to maneuver pieces. Win by capturing
  your opponent's Master (Way of the Stone) or moving your Master onto the
  opponent's Temple Arch (Way of the Stream). Each game uses only 5 of 16 movement
  cards, ensuring high replayability despite the elegant simplicity of the rules.
