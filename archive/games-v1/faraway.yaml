# Description
description: |
  Explore the mysterious continent of Alula by playing a row of eight region
  cards from left to right, each depicting landscapes and characters. The
  twist: scoring happens in reverse order on your return journey, so early
  card choices set conditions that later cards must fulfill. A clever hand
  management game with an innovative reverse-scoring mechanism.
