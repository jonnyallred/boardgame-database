# Description
description: |
  A cooperative detective game where players investigate criminal cases
  by examining a massive, highly detailed city map poster. The map
  simultaneously represents space and time, with characters depicted at
  multiple points in their stories. Players trace suspects' movements,
  find hidden evidence, and piece together crime narratives. Winner of
  the 2021 Spiel des Jahres.
