# Description
description: |
  Vie for control of the Iron Throne in this grand strategy game set in
  Westeros. Each player commands one of the Great Houses - Stark, Lannister,
  Baratheon, Greyjoy, Martell, or Tyrell - placing orders face-down on
  the board simultaneously, then revealing them to march armies, raid
  supply lines, defend strongholds, and consolidate power. Combat is
  resolved through card play rather than dice, with each house wielding
  a unique deck of character cards. The Iron Throne, Fiefdoms, and
  King's Court influence tracks provide additional asymmetric advantages.
  Negotiate alliances, but trust no one - only one house can rule.
