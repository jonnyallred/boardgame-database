# Description
description: |
  An elegant abstract strategy game set on the cliffs of the Greek island
  of Santorini. Players move workers and build a 3D cityscape of white and
  blue domed buildings, racing to reach the third level first. God power
  cards add asymmetric abilities that dramatically change the strategic
  landscape each game.
