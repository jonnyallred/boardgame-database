# Description
description: |
  Manage a deck of employees — apprentices, journeymen, and masters — to sew
  elegant dresses and coats for a grand Rococo-era ball. Over seven rounds,
  gather materials, tailor garments to place in the ballroom's halls for area
  majority scoring, hire new staff, and fund decorations. Features a unique
  deck-building twist where you choose which three cards to play each round
  from your entire hand rather than drawing randomly. Nominated for the 2014
  Kennerspiel des Jahres.
