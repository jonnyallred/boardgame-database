# Description
description: |
  Develop and colonize your planet by placing polyomino-shaped dual-resource
  tiles from a shared rotating space station (Lazy S.U.S.A.N.). Each tile
  placed advances two of six infrastructure tracks, triggering actions like
  collecting resources, moving rovers, and building tech. Simultaneous play
  eliminates downtime. With 49 asymmetric planet and corporation combos,
  every game presents a unique optimization puzzle.
