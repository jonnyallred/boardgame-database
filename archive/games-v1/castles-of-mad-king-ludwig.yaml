# Description
description: |
  Build an extravagant castle for King Ludwig II of Bavaria, one room at
  a time. Each round, the Master Builder sets prices for available rooms,
  and other players purchase them to add to their growing castles. Room
  placement matters - connecting rooms of complementary types earns bonus
  points, and completing a room by filling all doorways triggers special
  rewards. Score points for room sizes, secret bonus cards, and
  fulfilling the King's ever-changing favorites. The "I cut, you choose"
  pricing mechanism creates tense economic decisions every round.
