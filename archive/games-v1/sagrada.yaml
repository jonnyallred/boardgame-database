# Description
description: |
  Compete as artisans crafting stained glass windows for the Sagrada Familia
  cathedral in Barcelona. Each round, draft colorful translucent dice from a
  shared pool and place them onto your window pattern card, following strict
  color and shade adjacency restrictions. Use tool cards to bend placement
  rules and pursue secret and public scoring objectives based on color sets,
  shade values, and pattern arrangements. Beautiful production with 90
  translucent dice in five colors.
