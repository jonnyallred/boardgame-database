# Description
description: |
  Place workers on interconnected gears that rotate each round, moving
  your workers to increasingly powerful action spaces over time. Manage
  corn as currency, harvest resources from the jungle, build monuments,
  advance on temple tracks, and develop crystal skull technology to
  honor the Mayan gods. The central Tzolk'in gear drives the entire
  game forward — timing when to place and retrieve workers is the
  heart of every decision. A unique dynamic worker placement game
  where patience and planning are rewarded.
