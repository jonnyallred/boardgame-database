# Description
description: |
  Set in the 17th century Caribbean, players are seafarers and adventurers
  seeking wealth, fame, and influence. Move your ship along a rondel-style
  route, playing multi-use cards to build an economic engine, complete
  quests, and increase influence with European nations across four rounds.
  Features a nondestructive legacy-style campaign that introduces new
  characters, locations, and story elements over multiple plays. Designed
  by Alexander Pfister (Great Western Trail).
