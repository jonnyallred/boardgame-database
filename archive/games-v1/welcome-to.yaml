# Description
description: |
  Design a 1950s American dream suburb as an architect in this flip-and-write
  game. Each turn, three card combinations are revealed showing a house number
  and an action. All players simultaneously choose one combination, writing the
  house number on their street in ascending order and optionally using the
  action to build parks, pools, fences, or improve estates. Score points for
  completed city plans, largest parks, pool majorities, and estate values.
  Supports massive player counts since everyone plays at the same time with
  no downtime between turns.
