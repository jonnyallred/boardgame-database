# Description
description: |
  Guide multiple generations of a family through medieval village life.
  Manage family members across professions and areas—market, travel,
  crafting, church, and council. The innovative mechanic uses time as a
  resource: family members age and die, forcing tough decisions about when
  to let older generations pass. Successfully managing your family legacy
  and the village chronicle earns prestige. Winner of the 2012 Kennerspiel
  des Jahres.
