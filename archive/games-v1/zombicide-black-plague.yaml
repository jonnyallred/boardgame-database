# Description
description: |
  A cooperative dungeon-crawler that transports the zombie apocalypse
  to a medieval fantasy setting. Players control heroes wielding swords,
  crossbows, and spells against hordes of undead and their Necromancer
  overlords. Scenario-based missions on a modular board with highly
  detailed miniatures. Heroes level up during play, unlocking new
  abilities but also increasing zombie spawn rates.
