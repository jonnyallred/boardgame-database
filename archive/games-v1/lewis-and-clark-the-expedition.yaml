# Description
description: |
  Race westward across America in this Euro-style game themed around the
  historic Lewis and Clark expedition. Players manage a hand of character
  cards and Native American allies, using them to gather resources, recruit
  new expedition members, and advance along the trail. Efficient hand
  management is key, as unused cards slow your camp down.
