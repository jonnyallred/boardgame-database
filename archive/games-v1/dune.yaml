# Description
description: |
  A reprint of the legendary 1979 classic. Wildly asymmetric factions from
  Frank Herbert's Dune universe battle for control of Arrakis and its spice.
  Each faction has unique rule-breaking abilities. Alliance formation is
  central—factions share powers with allies, creating powerful combinations.
  Thrives on negotiation, bluffing, and political maneuvering. Combat uses
  hidden bidding with Treachery cards adding uncertainty. Best experienced
  at 5-6 players for full diplomatic tension.
