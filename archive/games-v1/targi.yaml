# Description
description: |
  Lead a Tuareg tribe in the desert, competing to collect resources,
  trade goods, and recruit tribe members. Place workers on a grid border
  to claim intersection cards — but your opponent can block your plans.
  A tight, brain-burning two-player-only game with meaningful decisions
  every turn. Nominated for the 2012 Kennerspiel des Jahres.
