# Description
description: |
  Investigate Lovecraftian horrors in a fully cooperative, app-driven
  board game. The companion app acts as the keeper, generating maps,
  managing monsters, and narrating the story. Explore modular tile
  layouts, solve puzzles, fight eldritch creatures, and unravel dark
  mysteries before time runs out. Each scenario offers unique objectives
  and branching narratives. The app replaces the adversarial keeper role
  from the first edition, making the game fully cooperative and
  streamlining setup.
