# Description
description: |
  Build rival civilizations in ancient Mesopotamia by placing tiles to
  expand kingdoms across four spheres: farming, trading, religion, and
  government. Deploy leaders to claim victory points, but beware of
  internal revolts and external wars when kingdoms collide. Your final
  score equals your weakest category, demanding balanced development.
  Widely regarded as Reiner Knizia's masterpiece.
