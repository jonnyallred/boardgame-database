# Description
description: |
  Compete across four seasons to build the most prosperous village.
  Bid with colored workers on hexagonal tiles - but the color you
  start bidding with locks everyone else into matching it. Place
  workers on tiles to activate them for resources and skills. New
  workers arrive each season aboard the Keyflower. In winter, score
  points for collected resources, skills, and village connections.
  A tense blend of auction and worker placement with hidden
  information and high interaction.
