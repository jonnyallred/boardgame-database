# Description
description: |
  Manage a grand hotel in the heart of Vienna during the modern age.
  Roll dice to populate a shared action board, then draft dice to serve
  guests with the right dishes and drinks, prepare colored hotel rooms,
  and hire staff cards for powerful abilities. Match guests to rooms of
  the correct color, fulfill their culinary orders, and check them in
  to score points. Earn the Emperor's favor across three rounds or face
  penalties. With 116 unique guest cards and variable setup, each game
  demands fresh tactical and strategic approaches.
