# Description
description: |
  Lead your clan to victory in legendary feudal Japan where the ancient
  Kami have returned to reshape the land. Over three seasons, negotiate
  alliances, recruit monsters, and wage war across provinces. Each season
  begins with a tea ceremony phase where players form temporary alliances,
  followed by mandate selection that drives political maneuvering. Combat
  is resolved through simultaneous blind bidding on different war
  advantages rather than dice, rewarding bluffing and reading opponents.
  Stunning miniatures and asymmetric clan powers create a deeply
  thematic experience of honor, betrayal, and conquest.
