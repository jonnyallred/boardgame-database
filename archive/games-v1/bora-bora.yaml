# Description
description: |
  Build huts, gather offerings, and explore the islands of Bora Bora in
  this quintessential Stefan Feld point salad Euro. Dice are placed on
  action spaces to activate abilities, but lower-valued dice can block
  higher ones, creating a unique tension. Multiple scoring paths and
  end-game objectives demand careful tactical planning each round.
