# Description
description: |
  Asymmetric tactical combat where legendary heroes clash on a shared
  battlefield. Each fighter has a unique deck of cards reflecting their
  abilities, from Medusa's stone gaze to King Arthur's noble strikes.
  Fast-playing duels with surprising depth from simple attack-and-defend
  card play and clever maneuvering on the board.
