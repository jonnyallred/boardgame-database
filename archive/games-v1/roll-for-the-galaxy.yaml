# Description
description: |
  A dice game of building space empires for 2-5 players. Your dice
  represent your populace, whom you direct to develop new technologies,
  settle worlds, and ship goods. The game uses simultaneous action
  selection where players secretly choose phases, then all selected
  phases occur. Build your tableau of worlds and developments to create
  powerful combos and trigger the endgame by placing twelve tiles.
  Dice version of Race for the Galaxy by Tom Lehmann.
