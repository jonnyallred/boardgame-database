# Description
description: |
  Set 71 years after the events of Season 1, the world has been ravaged by
  plague and humanity clings to survival in a network of floating havens.
  Players must supply dwindling cities while exploring a largely unknown
  world map. The core Pandemic mechanics are inverted - instead of removing
  disease cubes, players place supply cubes to keep cities from falling.
  Sealed packets and hidden compartments reveal new rules, locations, and
  story elements as the 12-24 session campaign unfolds. Permanent
  consequences shape each playthrough as characters evolve, cities change,
  and the mysteries of the plague are uncovered.
