# Game Researcher — Instance Memory

## Publisher-Specific Notes
- Repos Production: rprod.com/en/press/{slug} works better than /games/ (JS-heavy)
- Asmodee distributes Repos Production in North America
- Lookout Spiele (German) = Lookout Games (English) — use "Lookout Games"
- Plaid Hat Games: publishes Summoner Wars (Colby Dauch)
- Space Cowboys: publishes Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective since 2016

## Notable Game Notes
- Sidereal Confluence designer: "TauCeti Deichmann" (stylized, single string)
- Catan: original name "The Settlers of Catan" (1995), alternate names "Catan" + "Die Siedler von Catan"
- Scotland Yard (1983): 6 designers including first female SdJ winner
- Sherlock Holmes CD: purely narrative, no board/dice/tokens; 1-8 players
- Dune Express (2009): print-and-play, not commercial — minimal entry
- Doodletown (2022): very obscure — minimal entry
- Clash Royale Card Game: physical version by Ravensburger

## Workflow Notes
- Always check if `games/{slug}.yaml` exists before writing
- If file exists and is mostly complete, fix invalid tags rather than rewriting
- `plays_tracked` field: leave as-is in existing files; do NOT add to new entries

## Simone Luciani + Daniele Tascini
- Frequent co-designers (Marco Polo series, Grand Austria Hotel)
- Both have valid designer category tags in schema
