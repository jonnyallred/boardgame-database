Research board games and create `games/{slug}.yaml` for each. All reference data is below — no file reads needed.

## Input Modes

- **Single game:** `"Add Azul"` → research and create one entry.
- **Batch list:** A numbered list of games → process each in order using the per-game workflow below.

## Batch Rules

1. Process games in the numbered order given.
2. If a game fails (no sources found, pipeline error), mark it **Failed** in the summary and continue to the next game.
3. If a game already exists, mark it **Skipped** and continue.
4. If you notice response quality degrading (vague descriptions, missing fields), stop early and report remaining games as **Not attempted — context limit**.

## Per-Game Workflow (target ≤7 tool calls per game)

### 1. Collect URLs (WebSearch ×2-3)

Find Wikipedia, publisher site, and one retailer/review site. **Never use boardgamegeek.com.**

### 2. Run Pipeline (×1)

```bash
python3 scripts/game_pipeline.py "Game Name" --urls url1 url2 url3 --log game-slug
```

Returns JSON: `game_name` and `sources[]` (each: `url`, `source_type`, `text`).

### 3. Create YAML (Write ×1)

Extract from pipeline output: name, alternate names, year (this edition), designers, publishers, artists, player counts (box + optimal), playtime, min age, mechanics, description, expansion/family relationships.

Write `games/{slug}.yaml` matching the template below. Slug: lowercase, hyphen-separated (e.g., `ark-nova`). Filename must match `id`.

**Do NOT:** re-read written files, call pipeline more than once, use WebFetch, or read schema.yaml/publishers.yaml.

## Rating Scales (0-4)

- `length`: 0=Snack, 1=Short, 2=Medium, 3=Long, 4=Marathon
- `rules_complexity`: 0=Preschool, 1=Simple, 2=Moderate, 3=Complex, 4=PhD
- `strategic_depth`: 0=Reflex, 1=Light, 2=Moderate, 3=Deep, 4=Master Plan
- `feel`: 0=Solitary, 1=Light, 2=Moderate, 3=Competitive, 4=Fierce
- `value`: 0=Impulse, 1=Budget, 2=Standard, 3=Premium, 4=Heirloom
- `affinity` and `hotness`: always `null`

## Pre-Write Checks

- All categories from valid lists above
- Exactly 5 evokes from valid list
- `affinity` and `hotness` are `null`
- Both `possible_counts` and `true_counts` populated
- No boardgamegeek.com URLs

## Edge Cases

- **Already exists:** Check `games/{slug}.yaml`. Mark **Skipped**, move to next game.
- **Expansions:** Set `base_game`. Update parent's `expansions[]` if it exists.
- **Multiple editions:** Use `game_family` and `edition` to link.
- **Obscure:** Populate what you can, note limitations in description.
- **Duplicate within batch:** If the same game appears twice in a batch list, process it once and mark the duplicate **Skipped**.

## Results Summary

After processing all games (single or batch), output a summary table:

```
| # | Game               | Status    | File                        |
|---|--------------------|-----------|-----------------------------|
| 1 | Azul               | Created   | games/azul.yaml             |
| 2 | Brass: Birmingham  | Skipped   | (already exists)            |
| 3 | Nemesis            | Failed    | (no sources found)          |
| 4 | Dune: Imperium     | Created   | games/dune-imperium.yaml    |
```

Statuses: **Created**, **Skipped**, **Failed**, **Not attempted — context limit**
